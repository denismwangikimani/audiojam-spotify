Shake it up, up rock ya body  
Make it knock, knock when you partyin'  
Take a break, break in the audience  
Do ya footwork break and stop again?  
  
I'm lookin' sharp  
You can't compete with the champ  
Steady flickin'  
I'm holdin' done that layaway rack  
  
Aye, rhinestones all in they face  
Gold charms and paper chase  
Talk smack from around the way  
Gotta put these chickenheads in they place  
  
I ain't rockin' no stupid, babes  
I ain't trippin', I juke all day  
I ain't slippin' 'cause either way  
When I hit the block all the people say

Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'  
  
Aye yo this mothafucka jammin', I'm on it, it's a anthem  
Who is that in the Phantom? Please no cameras  
They gone have me on concrete loot in my pajamas  
To hide the goods, I would need pants big as Hammer's  
  
I be tippin' them dancers, they be sayin' I'm handsome  
I was pretty before the dough but now I'm just the man  
You remind me of my old chick on that '84 shit  
Oh shit, did you see the way she got her toes did?

Girls be so thirsty, thirsty  
Fast forward to the end of my song  
And say third verse me, verse me  
Whenever I hit the block I see  
  
Tricks try to rehearse me, hearse me  
From manicure sets to silky weaves  
They be so grimy, nasty, bogus  
Turkey, germy, dirty  
  
Uh oh, Shol' did, you ain't slick, no  
Let the pioneer blast my shit  
Wait a minute, hold up, nigga  
Bubble letters on my butt say fresh  
  
Oops, I'ma go, nails like whoa  
Acrylic base, top all gold  
Clothes on my back to the paint on my toes  
Stay fresh 'cause I'm accustomed to gold

Talking Heads,People Like Us,/t/talking+heads/people+like+us_20135111.html,"In 1950 when I was born  
Papa couldn't afford to buy us much  
He said be proud of what you are  
There's something special 'bout people like us  
  
People like us

People like us  
(Growing as big as a house)  
People like us  
(Gonna make it because)  
  
We don't want freedom  
We don't want justice  
We just want someone to love.  
Someone to love.u  
I was called upon in the third grade class  
I gave my answer and it caused a fuss  
I'm not the same as ev'ryone else

People like us  
(Who will answer the telephone)  
People like us  
(Growing as big as a house)  
People like us  
(Gonna make it because)  
  
What good is freedom?  
God laughs at people like us  
I see it coming  
Like coming down from above  
  
The clouds roll by and the moon comes up  
How long must we live in the heat of the sun  
Millions of people are waitin' on love  
And this is a song about people like us  
  
People like us  
(Who answer the telephone)  
People like us  
(Growing big as a house)  
People like us

Cause me shame, drag my name all over town  
Makes no difference what you say or what you do  
As for me I'll always be lovin' you  
  
[Chorus]  
My love for you was not built on shifting sands  
I made a promise long ago and it still stands  
Go on and do what your heart tells you to  
As for me I'll always be lovin' you  
  
You can change your dreams, change your heart  
Or change your mind  
And just pretend that it all ends with your goodbye  
You can walk out and forget the love we knew  
As for me I'll always be lovin' you

And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses

Spied a little thing and I followed her all night  
In a funky fine levis and her sweater's kind of tight  
She had a west coast strut that was as sweet as molases  
But what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Now go out and get yourself some big black frames  
With the glass so dark thay won't even know your name

Garth Brooks,Papa Loved Mama,/g/garth+brooks/papa+loved+mama_20058176.html,"Papa drove a truck nearly all his life  
You know it drove mama crazy being a trucker's wife  
The part she couldn't handle was the being alone  
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone  
Papa called Mama each and every night  
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright  
Mama would wait for that call to come in  
When Daddy'd hang up then she was gone again  
Mama was a looker  
Lord, how she shined  
Papa was a good'n  
But the jealous kind  
Papa loved Mama  
Mama loved men  
Mama's in the graveyard  
Papa's in the pen  
Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did  
Papa came home and it was just us kids  
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine  
If he was lookin' to surprise us, he was doin' fine  
I heard him cry for mama up and down the hall  
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall  
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound  
When Papa fired it up and headed into town  
Well, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well  
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel  
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear  
He never hit the brakes and he was shifting gears  
Mama was a looker  
Lord, how she shined  
Papa was a good'n  
But the jealous kind  
Papa loved Mama  
Mama loved men

W.A.S.P.,Sweet Cheetah,/w/wasp/sweet+cheetah_20348249.html,"One night as I rolled down some long winding road  
I saw you and I knew I couldn't let you go

Lost against the moonlight bathed in ecstasy  
Leopard's skin and cat's eyes  
Has the jungle made you wild  
The prey you're after, is you faster  
Will it make you smile  
Ride with me, I'll set you free  
Chains can't hold us down  
I need you, if you want me

Fever, fever, I love it, babe  
Come do it to me now  
  
Skin tight you move in so slowly to thrill  
Waiting for the nightmare then you're in for the kill  
Amazon so sleekly you know what to do  
Eat the flesh, and save my heart  
And leave it when you're through  
Pain and pleasures all mine  
Untamed and running wild  
Sink your teeth into me  
Lick your lips and smile  
Take my hand and ride the land  
Forever you and me  
Hold on tight to me all night  
And set your spirit free

Bon Jovi,Bed Of Roses,/b/bon+jovi/bed+of+roses_20022208.html,"Sitting here wasted and wounded  
At this old piano  
Trying hard to capture  
The moment this morning I don't know  
'Cause a bottle of vodka  
Is still lodged in my head  
And some blond gave me nightmares  
I think she is still in my bed  
As I dream about movies  
They won't make of me when I'm dead  
  
With an ironclad fist I wake up and  
French kiss the morning  
While some marching band keeps  
Its own beat in my head  
While we're talking  
About all of the things that I long to believe  
About love and the truth and  
What you mean to me  
And the truth is baby you're all that I need  
  
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails  
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on bed of roses  
  
Well I'm so far away  
That each step that I take is on my way home  
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night  
Just to see through this payphone  
Still I run out of time  
Or it's hard to get through  
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you  
I'll just close my eyes and whisper,  
Baby blind love is true  
  
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails  
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on bed of roses  
  
The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry  
The barkeeper's wig's crooked  
And she's giving me the eye  
I might have said yeah  
But I laughed so hard I think I died  
  
When you close your eyes  
Know I'll be thinking about you  
While my mistress she calls me  
To stand in her spotlight again  
Tonight I won't be alone  
But you know that don't  
Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove  
For it's you that I'd die to defend  
  
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails  
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on bed of roses

That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall

Don't leave without taking your silver. You left it right here in my hair.  
It's yours, for I didn't have it the moment you captured my soul. First a
little streak showed then slowly it wove it's way right in with the gold. I

But ain't got no plans  
Except to be your man  
And love you 'til I die  
  
Well you got me under your spell  
Won't you tell

And a lot to learn

'Bout you hear say  
But if you hold me tight  
It's gonna be all right

Faces,Stone,/f/faces/stone_20052416.html,"(ronnie lane)  
Once I was a stone many years ago  
Into a pool was thrown many years ago.  
Time passed by, the pool ran dry, excavated was i.  
And tempered and beat in a fiery heat,  
By the hand of a man, who's name was dan  
Dan the blacksmith.  
Once I was a sword, many years ago.  
And my blade was broad, many years ago.  
Worn with pride, into battle I'd ride at a warrior's side.  
And I cut and I killed and was lost in a field,  
And I soon did rust, corrode to dust,  
Oh my.  
Once I was a daisy, many years ago.  
In pastures green and lazy, many years ago.  
But I was et by a goat who fell in a moat and forgetting to float  
He sunk like a lead and stayed until dead,  
But was relieved to find just how kind it all was.  
Once I was a grub, many years ago.  
I lived in muck and mud, many years ago.  
But on the very first noon I became a cocoon that resembled a prune.  
When the good lord was done in the warmth of the sun.  
I shed my skins, and dried my wings, and I flew away.  
Once I was a bullfrog, had to struggle for survival.  
And once I was a carp and lived in waters ornamental.  
And once I was a myna bird, quoting verses from the bible,  
Said ""pretty boy, pretty boy, st. luke"".  
Once I was a mule, a many years ago.  
But my master treat me cruel, a many years ago.  
By and by I was sick, couldn't move to his kick, so he took out a stick  
And hit it right 'cross my back to an almighty crack,  
And to his dismay, I passed away, into the blue.  
I was born a human baby, many years ago.  
I was born unto a lady, many years ago.  
All our hopes they were piled on the back of a child that turned out to be
wild.  
Sent the devil a prayer and caused the parson to swear.  
So I took my leave to lie and thieve my way to jail.  
I've been tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor.  
I've known good times and disaster.  
But now I've found a teacher, and the teacher has a master,  
The master is perfection, so he'll help us get there faster.  
I don't need no proof, because that's the truth, and I'll drink to that.

On a mission fishing for feddy, ready to make a knot  
I'm use to having less, and I just can't deal with the stress  
And it seems like everywhere I go, another nigga want to test  
Brother don't disrespect yourself and get yourself up in a, vine  
Cause I'm a maniac with a mac, and a black back-pack  
Smoking up on the urban fat sack, I'm trying to keep from going off  
But niggas be trying to make me starve, when I need groceries in my house  
Wicked niggas say they be friends, but end up trying to kill your friends  
Always turn to foes, that's saying it's over millions  
Dealing with dirty niggas on a daily basis  
Don't really want to fuck with em, but see they baby faces  
I gotta survive  
[Chorus - 2x]  
Let me live my life, nigga don't fuck with me  
To deal out these deeds, then you die  
And when it's my time hope I don't, cry

Living in the ghetto, day by day  
I'm bumping trying to make a profit, cause I gotta get my pay  
You better, keep watching me and  
Pretty soon, you'll see man  
That I'm a real rich nigga from the Houston streets  
Fried out licking, looking for something to eat  
I'm on a mission, whipping birds like they stole something  
Pain, it make me want to roll something  
I'm a soldier, and I'm outta my mind  
Voice mail beeping for days, cause I'm out on the grind  
Guess my daddy didn't love me, cause he turned his back  
Therefor the streets is my people, a nigga learned like that  
And I haaaad to get up, and bleed the block  
And it don't stop  
[Chorus - 2x]

My nigga Herman Fisher doing fed time  
I remember like it was yesterday, it made the headlines, damn  
I had to start all over, but it didn't matter cause I was a soldier  
Walking around with a king size chip on my shoulder  
Missing my mama while I Iay down, on benches to sleep  
Snatching purses and hopping fences just to eat  
Still I maintain, I'm still in the same game chasing paper  
Bitch niggas be up in my business, like oops I'm erasing haters  
I'm S.U.C. for life, KMJ until I'm finished  
Like Popeye from the ghetto, but a nigga don't need no spinach  
All I need is my Nina when I be flipping birds  
Cause all I have in this world, is my balls and my word

A little Father Cribari wine

Peter Gabriel,Modern Love,/p/peter+gabriel/modern+love_20107461.html,"Hey, I'm feeling so dirty, you're looking so clean  
All you can give is a spin in your washing machine  
I fly off to Rome to my prima bella  
She leaves me in the rain with telescopic umbrella  
Ooh the pain -- Modern love can be a strain  
  
I trusted my Venus was untouched in her shell  
But the pearls in her oyster were as tacky as hell  
For Lady Godiva I came incognito  
But her driver had stolen her red hot magneto  
Ooh the pain, modern love can be a strain  
  
I don't know why they leave me in the lurch  
To carry on the search  
It's driving me up the wall  
Pity when I have so much passion  
Romance is out of fashion  
Can't handle modern love at all  
  
So I worship Diana by the light of the moon  
When I pull out my pipe she screams out of tune  
In Paris my heart sinks when I see the Mona Lisa  
She gives me the wink, then she shows me the freezer  
Ooh the pain  
Modern love can be a strain

And you can see how clear the Pile Vase, and the Canaries be now  
The top on the 5 series be down  
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now  
Although there was a time I would barely see fowls  
But I'm gettin' a multi-million dollar yearly fee now  
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now  
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now  
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now  
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds  
I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now  
Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round  
Everybody staring unnecessarily now  
But there's no tints on my lights, so you can clearly see now

But y'all gotta peep this rookie's improvement

Cause most dudes was doin' verses for a few dollars and a hook for a few cents  
All I do is try to teach and look to influence  
But it look like the students are playin' hooky, and truin'  
And some say that we lookin' like new gents

When I eat, I order the same old entree  
When I ride, I let the same old songs play  
And when I work, I do the same old long days  
From bein' Fab, to looked at by dames the wrong way  
They know where we came, from the name they call me  
I already know what these lames is gonna say  
And I already seen what games they gonna play  
Fuck with family, don't say the name the wrong way  
And when you die, Y'all crackers gonna blame it on strays

The love I know is a love so few discover  
They need to know Jesus' love is like no other  
They say love is cruel, they say love is rather fragile  
But I've found in You a love of another kind  
They say love brings hurt I say love brings healing  
Understanding first it's a love of another kind  
They save love won't last I say love is never ending  
'Cause in You I have a love of another kind  
They would change their tune they would add another measure  
If they only knew this love of another kind  
Love of another kind  
The love of another kind  
The love of another kind  
The love of another, the love of another kind  
Give me love this is love  
(This is love)  
Another kind, another kind of love  
This is love  
(This is love)  
You need another kind of love  
Another kind, another kind of love  
Another kind of love  
This is love  
(Give me love)  
Another kind, another kind of love

You make me weak  
You lift me off my feet  
You give me hope  
When all my dreams  
Seem like theyre out of reach  
You make me understand  
The way the perfect love should be  
You take me to a place  
So high  
I never wanna leave  
Sometimes all the things  
I should have said  
I hope its not too late  
I wanna make you understand  
If the world came crashing down over me  
I know that my life is complete  
Cause Ive held you  
In my arms all night  
Cause I cant imagine life  
Without you by my side  
You whisper in my ears the words:  
Just hold me close tonight  
And then the pain is holding me  
Your love just set me free!

Was in his foreign car

I think I must know

The feelings I keep  
Like the man in the moon  
You're way out of reach  
  
So dreams are all I have  
Because we're worlds apart  
All alone with my secret heart  
  
I write you these letters  
That I'll never send  
It's crazy I know  
But still I pretend  
Though we've never met  
Don't think I'm naive  
I know you so well  
Though it's all make believe  
  
And dreams are all I have  
Because you're far away  
All alone with my secret heart  
All alone with my secret heart  
  
I must have held your hand  
A thousand times  
And felt your heart was beating  
Next to mine  
Even though it's just a lie  
There are no tears in my eyes  
  
If your picture could speak to me  
What would you say  
Maybe you'd just have to  
Laugh in my face  
  
And dreams would be much better  
Than reality  
  
All alone with my secret heart

Sting,Mad About You,/s/sting/mad+about+you_20132092.html,"A stone's throw from Jerusalem  
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight  
And though a million stars were shining  
My heart was lost on a distant planet  
That whirls around the April moon  
Whirling in an arc of sadness  
I'm lost without you. I'm lost without you  
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand  
And fall into the sea  
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you  
And from the dark secluded valleys  
I heard the ancient songs of sadness  
But every step I thought of you  
Every footstep only you  
And every star a grain of sand  
The leavings of a dried up ocean  
Tell me, how much longer? How much longer?  
They say a city in the desert lies  
The vanity of an ancient king  
But the city lies in broken pieces  
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing  
These are the works of man  
This is the sum of our ambition  
It would make a prison of my life  
If you became another's wife  
With every prison blown to dust  
My enemies walk free  
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you  
And I have never in my life  
Felt more alone than I do now  
Although I claim dominions over all I see  
It means nothing to me  
There are no victories  
In all our histories, without love  
A stone's throw from Jerusalem  
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight  
And though a million stars were shining  
My heart was lost on a distant planet  
That whirls around the April moon  
Whirling in an arc of sadness  
I'm lost without you. I'm lost without you  
And though you hold the keys to ruin  
Of everything I see  
With every prison blown to dust,  
My enemies walk free  
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand  
And fall into the sea  
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you

Are you hopeful are you haunted  
By the ghost of Christmas past  
Face the future Undaunted  
Step aside or take your chance  
  
Run with the fox  
Into the wind on to the dawn of tomorrow  
Run with the fox  
Into the wild into the wild and the cold  
Beware of the rocks  
And be prepared prepare for love comes and goes

Won or lost before begun  
While we thrive on mass confusion  
Thus we walk before we run  
  
Run with the fox  
Into the wind on to the dawn of tomorrow  
Run with the fox  
Into the wild into the wild and the cold  
Beware of the rocks  
And be prepared prepare for love finally grows  
  
Let us live to tell our story  
Here on earth and out in space  
Forward on the road to glory  
History records the chase  
  
Have yourselves that certain Christmas  
Eat be glad and drink the wine  
Leave your sadness by the river  
Giving love and given time  
  
Across the ice of frozen lakes  
Run with the fox  
Along the lanes a lover takes  
Run with the fox  
Beneath the moon a Christmas moon  
Run with the fox  
And sing a tune a dreamers tune  
Run with the fox  
Across the bridge of many ways  
Run with the fox  
On to the planes where dreamers play  
Run with the fox

Keith Urban,Thank You,/k/keith+urban/thank+you_20837391.html,"There were nights where I was sure  
I wouldn't see the morning sun  
And there were days that seemed so dark  
I couldn't wait for night to come  
  
I couldn't stand to think about how  
My life used to be  
And how without a single warning  
It all slipped away from me  
  
And like a fool I thought that I could fight  
The shadows on my own  
To the dark I was no stranger  
But this was stronger than I'd known  
  
And by the time I knew that I was in too deep  
I'd gone too far  
And the light that used to guide me  
Had faded from my heart  
  
And I found myself in places I thought I'd never go  
Surrounded by strangers I was so far from home  
And I don't know how you found me  
All I know is I owe you everything to you  
Yes I do  
  
[Chorus]  
And I thank you for my heart  
I thank you for my life  
And I thank god for grace and mercy  
And that you became my wife  
I'm seeing for the first time  
The stars, the sun and moon  
But they've got nothing on the power  
Of this love I have for you  
  
And I thank you, I thank you  
  
Now people say they'll stand beside you  
They swear they never leave  
But when the rain started falling  
You know it only fell on me  
  
and it was hard to keep believing in myself  
When all I felt was so much pain  
And guilt and shame  
I couldn't even as for help  
  
I don't know if I believe in other lives  
But when you came  
There was something so familar  
About the way you said my name  
  
And the whole world started turning  
And I swear that I'd been born again brand new  
And it's all because of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I thank you  
  
And I've seen so many things  
That I just can't explain  
But the miracle of miracles is how  
With your love I was saved  
  
And I thank you for my heart  
I thank you for my life  
I thank god for grace and mercy  
And that you became my wife  
And I'm seeing for the first time  
The stars, the sun and moon  
But they've got nothing on the power  
Of all this love I give to you  
  
And I thank you for my heart  
I thank you for my life  
I thank god for grace and mercy  
And that you became my wife  
The day I started breathing  
Was the day you took my hand  
And 'till the day I die  
Baby, I'll forever be your man  
And I thank you, I thank you  
Oh, yes I do  
Oh, don't you know, that I thank you  
Oh

Everyone and everything is in a hopeless mess  
Arguing and fighting  
Everyone and everything is in a hopeless mess  
Arguing and fighting  
So what can we do about it  
  
How about doing more listening than talking  
Giving everyone the benefit of the doubt  
People say give and take  
Why can't we give and give  
People say give and take  
Why can't we give and give  
  
This isn't exactly going to bring about peace in the world  
But it's something  
But it's something  
And we will probably still have a bad time

Que le ciel m'avait donne  
De naitre ou les caresses sentent bon  
Si je dois courir le monde  
Mes pas me rameneront  
Toujours sur les chemins de ma maison  
  
And I understood the chance  
The sky has given me  
To born where caresses smell good  
If I have to run over the world  
My steps will take me back  
Always on the paths of my house  
See'est la que j'ai grandi  
La que l'on m'a aime  
La que j'ai couru  
La que j'ai chante  
L'odeur do feu de bois  
La chaleur do bon pain  
Mon dieu mon dieu  
  
It's there that I've grown up  
There that I have been loved  
There I ran  
There I sang  
The smell of the wood fire  
The warmth of the good bread  
My god my god  
Si j'ecrivais le livre de ma vie  
Il s'ouvrirait avec le coeur  
De ceux qui m'aiment  
Tous ceux qui aussi veulent faire  
En se levant chaque jour  
Un monde ou les caresses sentent bon  
Ceux qui sont dans mes prieres  
Et tous ceux qui m'attendront  
Toujours sur les chemins de ma maison  
  
If I was writting the book of my life  
It would open with the heart  
Of those who love me  
All those who also want to do  
Waking every morning  
A world where caresses smell good  
Those who are in my prayers  
And all those who will wait me  
Always on the paths of my house  
Sur les chemins de ma maison  
Sur les chemins de ma maison  
  
On the paths of my house  
On the paths of my house

I see it somehow  
You know what I mean, don't you  
Don't you  
Say what you mean  
I've said it so well

Yes I do  
Saw you layin under my car, but you took it too far  
Don't you know  
Held your hand, as you, slipped away  
Watched your eyes turn to grey tonight

I'm just driving away, from the side of you laying in death  
Goodbye before I cry  
I know you feel for me too  
And I do

These are the tales that I tell so well  
These are the tales the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
  
I met this girl her name was Joan  
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone  
When I met Joan I took her home  
She was just like a doggie all on my bone  
  
I met another girl her name was Ann  
All she wanted was to freak with a man  
When I met Ann, I shook her hand  
We ended up freakin' by a garbage can  
  
The next young freak, I met was Red  
I took her to my house and she gave me head  
She like blowin' dicks, is all she said  
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed  
  
There's another girl, her name is Sherry  
You talk about sex and the girl acts scary  
I heard she was freakin' from my big brother Jerry  
Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry  
  
Young and tender, sweet Denise  
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast  
I tell you homeboy if you get a piece  
She'll only start talkin' bout signin' a lease  
  
I met a young tender, her name is Lori  
An X-Rated movie wouldn't tell her story  
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa  
And just like Lori she's a real dick pleaser  
  
My girlfriend's name, was Michelle  
Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale  
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well  
Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell  
  
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammi  
I didn't want to do it cause the bitch was 'flantly'  
She had a best friend, her name was Janet  
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game  
  
I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan  
I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam  
The very next day, I saw her with her man  
One week passed, and I was in her again  
  
I had an old tender, her name's Jeanine  
She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen  
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend  
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans  
  
I want a big freak, fat and sloppy  
I kick on back, and watch the hoe just mop me  
Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta  
A country broad from Alabama  
  
I met this freak, her name was Beth  
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death  
I was tired as Hell, I was drippin' sweat  
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath  
  
Bake, and, shake, ups  
I met this freak in Vegas  
She she said her name was Don-na  
She was a ?belt? lil' freak from Chi-na  
  
I said, ""I don't pimp, or gigolo  
I'm havin' so much paper I don't need a hoe  
You can break yourself, but you can't break me  
You never met a player like Snoop baby""  
  
I knew a dick sucker named Betty Joe  
I took her to my house and we did it on the flo'  
The girl got freaky let me tell you mo'  
She was down on her knees, beggin' to blow  
  
She's like another freak, named Renee  
You get her all alone and she'll make your day  
Like Burger King, she knows the play  
and with a freak like Renee you can Have It Your Way  
  
These are the tales, the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well  
These are the tales, the freaky tales  
These are the tales that I tell so well!

And the places I have been at times, just trying to be,  
These things can only happen once in a lifetime,  
These things can only matter here if you have time.

Someone will call your name and then come to me, free.  
Free as the wind, free as the rain falling,  
Free as the night, free as nature calling ...

Dying says nothing at all

Watching the evening fall  
  
Time flows  
Through brave beginnings  
And she leaves her endings  
Beneath our feet  
Walk lightly  
Upon their faces  
Leave gentle traces  
Upon their sleep  
  
Living is dancing  
Dying does nothing at all

Hard luck and good times  
Fast lines and low rhymes

Feel fine  
Feel low and lazy  
Feel grey and hazy  
Feel far away

Dying ain't flying so high

Electric Light Orchestra,After All,/e/electric+light+orchestra/after+all_20800586.html,"The night has a thousand eyes  
And they're all on you  
The night has a thousand ears  
Listening to your cries  
Let it work its magic  
Let it work its magic  
The night has a thousand eyes  
  
You, you had to slip away  
After all that spark  
You, said all that you could say  
And slipped into the dark  
I could not let you go  
Alone into the night  
I had to let you know  
The magic there, in the night air  
  
The night has a thousand eyes  
And they're all on you  
The night has a thousand ears  
Listening to your cries  
Let it work its magic  
Let it work its magic  
The night has a thousand eyes  
  
You, somewhere out in the dark  
Runs a wounded heart  
You, stumbling in the night  
In the air of after light  
You take along the fears  
Did you waste these years  
And did they warn you  
Of the night zone all alone  
  
Sometimes it takes a fight  
To keep everything on track  
And sometimes it takes a starry night  
To bring the magic back  
This was the time  
And this was the place  
With starlight on your face  
And the moon on the rise  
The night has a thousand eyes

In empty hallways  
Pale dead moon  
And the sky streaked with grey  
Human kindness overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today  
  
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles  
With frozen smiles to keep love away  
Human kindness overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today  
  
Lonely, lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
I think I'll kick it down the street  
That's the way to treat a friend  
  
Right before me  
The signs implore me  
Help the needy  
And show them the way  
Human kindness, it's overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today  
  
Lonely, so lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
I think I'll kick it down the street

Help the needy

I know the changes kinda scary  
But maybe I should try to vary

Some minor details  
A small degree  
A slightly different version of me

Well I could learn to cook vegetarian  
Or take fashion workshop  
Meditate, calculate  
Learn to knit a tank top  
  
Yoga, hula  
Clogging, jogging  
Walking on a tight rope  
Take a correspondence course  
And learn to make my own soap  
  
Jumping on a pogo stick  
Standing in a wheat field  
Going on a snipe hunt  
Gonna keeps my eyes peeled  
Take a little time to really decorate my door  
And change my hair to black and then I'll dye it back orange  
  
Underwater taxidermy  
Shopping for a suitcase  
Peeling tangerines while placing second in a sack race  
  
Lion taming, online gaming  
Try'n to win a prize fight  
Appear in a talk show  
Dress-up like a water sprite  
  
Yeah!  
I'm gonna be extraordinary  
I'm gonna stand out from the crowd  
And shout out loud  
You'll see  
That it's a brand new me!!

Was all she'd left behind without a last adieu  
Sometimes I wonder if she'd left a hundred years ago  
To start anew we need to be strangers from now on  
And as for love we need to be strangers from now on  
  
And I remember when she came into my life  
It didn't count who she was or what I was like  
I never meant to hurt her but she never did  
Her name was love, her bodies infinite  
And now she is gone, the capsule empty and her body dead  
Sometimes I wonder if she'd left a hundred years ago  
To start anew we need to be strangers from now on

Sucked along by a winter shower  
To stand beside your shining tower

This could be our very last chance

And then the world's all right with me

The way that you talk  
Just the sound of your voice  
And I ain't got no choice  
The light was going out, the moon was dying  
The night was turning to a fine spring morning  
The dogs were barking and the kids were shouting  
The sun was splashing in a crystal fountain  
When the cold winds come and find you  
Blowing down from the top of the high rise  
I'll come and take you back down to Soho  
Away from all those mad men's eyes

This could be our very last chance

So that they can't fly?  
Would you take the ocean's roar  
And leave just a sigh?

This is what I beg of you  
Don't take your love from me

My attitude has always been you can have me for tonight  
But not for tomorrow  
It's gonna cost you plenty, more than you can afford  
More than you can borrow

Pick their pockets hey

And make my getaway

Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight  
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes  
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine  
  
I met you on a starry night, full moon in your eyes  
Did something strange to me  
I was all prepared to spin my web, take you for a ride  
But there was a fork in the street  
Well I didn't mean to fall in love, didn't practice the rules  
That I've been taught  
You never get involved, never drop your defences  
But this time I got caught  
  
I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night  
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight  
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes  
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine

I walked and did some window shopping  
And met someone I used to know  
  
The years had been kind to her beauty  
When I first saw her my heart jumped  
Tonight if I seem disenchanted  
I took a memory to lunch  
  
We sat and talked about the old days  
With misty teardrops in our eyes  
And reconfirmed an old suspicion  
The past grows old but never dies  
  
The charm that draws two hearts together  
By four o' clock was just too much  
The days and years we had between us  
Were down to just two coffee cups  
  
You can't relive life in an hour  
The afternoon kept wearing on  
I'm sorry that I'm late for dinner  
I took a memory to lunch

Murder at the senior prom  
Mass murder at the senior prom x2  
I padlocked the gym doors the night of the senior prom  
Under the bleachers I planted several pipe bombs  
Stood up on the balcony sub-machine gun in my hand  
Said ""I'm your new prom king, does everybody understand?""  
Rounded up all the jocks who used to chase me home from school  
Tied their hands and feet and pushed them in the swimming pool  
Lined all the teachers who flunked me up against a wall  
Then one by one I stuck a butcher knife into them all  
Found that little fuck who got me busted for smokin' dope  
Now he's hanging from the flag pole kicking at the end of a rope  
Last but certainly not least when everybody else was dead  
I sodomized the cheerleaders and then I cut off all their heads

Emmylou Harris,Heaven Only Knows,/e/emmylou+harris/heaven+only+knows_20050042.html,"Every night it's the same  
I feel your heart turn cold as rain  
And know that you'll be gone again  
I hear the front door close  
You say you got to go downtown  
I guess there's someone else you've found  
So why you're still coming round  
Heaven only knows  
  
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  
Make me feel like I could die  
That's the way it goes  
Heaven only ever sees  
How love's made a fool of me  
I guess that's how it's meant to be but  
Heaven only knows  
  
I've heard it said that talk is cheap  
But still your words they cut so deep  
Lay me crying in my sleep  
And the pain just grows  
I don't know who's right or wrong  
But all we had is dead and gone  
So why you keep me hanging on  
Heaven only knows  
  
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  
Make me feel like I could die  
That's the way it goes  
Heaven only ever sees  
How love's made a fool of me  
I guess that's how it's meant to be but  
Heaven only knows  
  
I'm going to turn and walk away  
There's nothing left for me to say  
It wouldn't change things anyway  
Though, I suppose  
The love I gave was always true  
Well, I don't know what else to do  
And how I'll ever get over you  
Heaven only knows  
  
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  
Make me feel like I could die  
That's the way it goes  
Heaven only ever sees

People play tricks of the mind  
Shadows only follow behind

Of all on malvern's hill  
Who'd taken a lead off third base

If fate were to follow fortune  
And clarity trail distortion  
Sister on alert  
Pay close attention  
To fingerprints in the dust  
And fallen feet that leave no trace  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place  
  
Sincerely now...  
I requested information  
At a roadside station  
Sister it seems absurd  
To be hammering pith  
Like a poet with a loss for words  
Trying to describe an angel's face  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place  
  
Honestly now...  
Wholly in demand  
Coming off second hand  
Sister don't unravel  
When there's nowhere to go  
Except lawless travel  
And an end to infinity's space  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place

To the ground because I care

When I smile I beguile all the while every mile  
As I walk across the sky  
Of the clockwork of your eye  
You will be love and your love will live  
Casting spells from the well I can tell you the bells  
Listen to my magic voice  
Learn the tune of children's toys  
You will be love and your love will live  
When I die do not cry hear my sigh passing by  
After I have turned to win  
I will try to help you then  
You will be love and your love will live

You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life  
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive  
Let me tell you all about it  
And the world will so allow it  
Ooh give me a little time to choose  
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight  
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night  
  
Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile  
Fie-fo the black Queen, marching single file  
Take this, take that, bring them down to size  
March to the Black Queen  
  
Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys  
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a baby oil  
(aah aah) black on (aah aah), black on every finger nail and toe  
We've only begun - begun  
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise

But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love

Neil Diamond,I'm A Believer,/n/neil+diamond/im+a+believer_20098858.html,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales  
Meant for someone else but not for me  
Love was out to get me  
That's the way it seemed  
Disappointment haunted all my dreams  
  
Then I saw her face  
Now I'm a believer  
Not a trace of doubt in my mind  
I'm in love  
I'm a believer  
I couldn't leave her if I tried  
  
I thought love was more or less a giving thing  
Seems the more I gave the less I got  
What's the use in trying  
All you get is pain  
When I needed sunshine I got rain  
  
Then I saw her face  
Now I'm a believer  
Not a trace of doubt in my mind  
I'm in love  
I'm a believer  
I couldn't leave her if I tried

Passes by just like mine  
It's not complicated  
  
Another mind  
Another soul  
Another body to grow old  
It's not complicated

Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And you're miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
  
Another tear  
Another cry  
Another place for us to die  
It's not complicated  
  
Another love that's gone to waste  
Another light lost from your face  
It's complicated  
  
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And you're miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
  
Ooh how I miss you  
My symphony played the song that carried you out  
Ooh how I miss you  
And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay  
  
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And you're miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
  
Touch down  
Like a seven four seven  
Or stay out and we'll live forever now

As the look you give me

So say you have nowhere else to go  
And nothing to do  
So you hang around

But you wait around until  
You've received that fatal wound  
  
Columns of sunlight  
And glorious cities  
Oceans of opportunity  
And all your decisions seem ancient  
  
But you wait around until  
You've received that fatal wound

A million to one - that's what it will be  
A million to one - there's someone better than me  
A million to one - no, you never will find  
A million to one - another love like mine

But everytime I try to open your eyes, I'm damned and I'm no good  
Day after day, you're further away, I can't take anymore  
So it's time that you go, but I want you to know, I won't stand in your way  
Deep in my heart I know, girl you're runnin' away  
  
A million to one  
One of these days you'll come out of your haze, no matter what you do  
It'll be too late, something good won't wait, love is runnin' out on you  
A million to one, a million to one  
  
A million to one - listen to your heart girl - a million to one - oh

Where you have offered my faith and my trust  
Until all is lost into the beauty of the day.

That makes me feel like a child  
Aspects of life they confuse me  
You and your thesis amuse me.

And your rich brown eyes  
Your lips and your dark hair  
Elbows and exposed knees tossing toward the ceiling  
After an afternoon.

Tear to tear  
Mouth to tongue  
Heart to ground  
I am in love.

Don't you want to be happy  
  
Don't you know how good I could be  
Seems everybody's telling you something  
That they know you just want to hear  
Oh but you ain't gonna hear it from me  
  
You've been a valley of love  
And a mountain of need  
Baby, it's time you see  
  
You've got me up and down and in between  
Acting nice then being real mean  
Hey  
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back  
  
Who could deal with that  
You say you want to work it out, boy  
Tell me what's in it for me  
  
Up and down and in between  
Acting nice then being real mean  
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back

You say you want to work it out boy  
Tell me what's in it for me  
  
You've been a river of give and a mountain of take  
Darlin' for Heaven's sake  
  
You've got me up and down and in between

Marillion,Emerald Lies,/m/marillion/emerald+lies_20088853.html,"To be the prince of possession in the gallery of contempt  
Suffering your indiscreet discretions and you ask me to relent  
As you accumulate flirtations with the calculated calmness of the whore  
I am the harlequin - diamonded costume dripping shades of green  
I am the harlequin - sense strangers violate my sanctuary  
Prowl my dreams  
Plundering your diaries, I'll steal your thoughts innocence  
Ravaging your letters, unearth your plots innocence  
To don the robes of Torquemada, resurrect the inquisition  
In that tortured subtle manner inflict questions within questions  
Looking in shades of green through shades of blue  
I trust you trust in me to mistrust you  
Through the Silk Cut haze to the smeared mascara  
A 40 watt sun on a courtroom drama  
And the coffee stains gather till the pale kimono  
Set the wedding rings dancing on the cold linoleum  
And accusations moths that circle on the light  
Char their wings and spiral senseless suicidal flight  
You packed your world within a suitcase, hot tears melt this icy palace  
Dissolve a crystal swallowed by the night  
Looking in shades of green through shades of blue  
Looking in shades of green through shades of blue

Like horseshoes I was tossin them o's  
Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow

I hug the block  
I'm so emotional  
I love my glock  
Cash rules everything around me  
So what's realer  
Bout the scriller so call me a ghost face killa  
Its kinda hard to be drug free  
When georgia power won't give a nigga lights free  
Switched hustles been killin' 'em ever since  
Been paid to tell the truth it only make sense  
  
[Chorus]  
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy  
And watch the dope boys go crazy  
I pop my collar then I swing my chain  
If you catch me in the club pimpin' doing my thing  
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy  
And watch the dope boys go crazy  
They pop my collar then they swing they chain  
All the gangstas in the street that be doin' they thing  
  
By 18 the hard way  
Now have a humble nigga thinkin' 'bout gun play  
Now who the fuck want to play with guns  
A lotta hoes a lotta blood dog  
That shit ain't fun  
So I suggest that you don't play with my chain  
Or I'll send these hollow's at you  
Let them play with ya brain  
The streets is watchin'  
The name is warm  
The products white  
A star is born  
Pimpin' I'm so fly  
I take this parachute off  
I might fall and die  
Wrap the work with spandex with the latex  
Then we ship it outta town  
Call it safe sex

Uh, more than a hustla I'm the definition of it  
Master chef, lord of the kitchen cupboard  
More than a street legend, homey it's hova  
More than a relief pitcher, I'm the closer  
The Mariano of the Marriott, ah  
If money talks, the whole world's bout to hear me out  
See I'm a hustler's hope, I'm not his pipe dreams  
So when they speak of success, I'm what they might mean  
Attract money my worst color is light green  
My favorite hue is Jay-Z blue  
Don't follow me young'n, follow my moves, I'm not a role model  
A bad influence got the world drinkin gold bottles  
When puff was in that tub spillin mo'  
I was at my video, cris' on the speedboat  
In my lifetime nigga, go through your research  
St. Thomas my nigga, that was me first  
Chrome shoe'd the gs, I came feet first  
In the game like a baby boo on the breach birth  
I got the keys if you need work  
I can kingpin you a line, the diamond of time (uhh)  
My niggaz love it when I talk like this  
My corporate people start buggin cause I talk like this  
The corporate thugs is like, ""Nah hov, talk that shit""  
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy jay-z  
See I'ma '80s baby, master  
School of hard knocks, everyday is college  
You ain't did nothin I ain't did, nigga pay homage  
Or pay the doctor, I sprayed lami's  
Still, the time'll reveal, you know I'm bein honest  
Ya ain't put my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check  
They say the truth shall come to the light  
So everybody grab your chains cause your boy that bright

He's been doing the same job now going on two thousand years  
He's got pains in his brain and chimney scars cover his buns  
He hates to admit it, but Xmas is more work than fun  
  
He needs a vacation from bad decorations and snow  
Mr. Claus has a has escape plans, a secret that only he knows  
Beaches and palm trees appear night and day in his dreams  
A break from his wife, half-frozen in life  
The elves and that damn reindeer team

He thinks about boat drinks and fun in the sun]

Plastic creations and crass exploitations aren't good  
He wants to go back to simple toys made out of wood  
Just for the weekend he's like to be Peter Pan  
Get out of his long johns and dance with a sword in the sand

From the vacant chair  
Looking in the mirror  
While she's combing her hair  
Wipes the dust from a cup  
While she's cleaning up  
Wonders very slightly  
What she's doing there  
A simple reflection  
Can be too revealing  
Years are for counting  
Years are for stealing  
She's a mathematician  
Calculator  
Counting daily  
Counting forever  
Cold clean glass and a razor blade  
Fly on the table and a passing car  
Closes the curtain to keep in the shade  
Closes her head and now she's counting down  
Dust is collecting  
But she doesn't notice  
Counting for ever  
She's a calculator  
No-one can see her  
She's invisible now  
No-one can see her  
And the dust is collecting

Joni Mitchell,Conversation,/j/joni+mitchell/conversation_20075372.html,"He comes for conversation  
I comfort him sometimes  
Comfort and consultation  
He knows that's what he'll find  
I bring him coffees and cheeses  
He brings me songs to play  
He sees me when he pleases  
I see him in cafes  
And I always say, hello  
And turn away before his lady knows  
How much I want to see him  
She removes him, like a ring  
To wash her hands  
She only brings him out to show her friends  
I want to free him  
  
Secrets and sharing soda  
That's how our time began  
Love is a story told to a friend  
It's second hand  
But I'll listen to his questions  
I'll give my answers when they're found  
He says she keeps him guessing  
I know she keeps him down  
She speaks in sorry sentences  
Miraculous repentances  
I don't believe her  
Tomorrow he will come to me  
And he'll speak his sorrows endlessly and he'll ask me why  
Why can't I leave her?  
  
He comes for conversation  
I comfort him sometimes  
Comfort and consultation  
He knows that's what he'll find  
He knows that's what, he'll find

I don't give a fuck if they get into the chart, oh no  
Only way I can be, is to say what I see  
And have my shadow hanging over me

To please everybody all of the time  
'Cause everybody always fucking changes their mind  
A little bit of faith and a little bit of chain  
Don't want to stop, won't be persuaded  
To write words I can't believe in, to see my face on a video screen

There's a very big difference between above and below  
A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor  
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow  
Here, above land, man has laid his plan  
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan  
We got a government so twisted and bent  
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent  
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution  
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution  
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution  
If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution  
And that's a heart felt shame  
'cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same  
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?  
Time now to take you to a different place  
Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space  
A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace  
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace  
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none  
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun  
No one tells 'em how their life is run  
And no one points at them with a gun  
They have a lot of love for every living creature  
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature  
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher  
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you  
Back to the land of the police man  
Where he does whatever he says he can  
Including hating you because you're a Jew  
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new  
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl  
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all  
They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails  
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail  
So support your police, support your local wars  
That's the way to open economic doors  
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore  
We assume the position to sell the ammunition  
What the fuck? It's the american tradition  
Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen  
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?

Avril Lavigne,Kathy's Song,/a/avril+lavigne/kathys+song_20517904.html,"[Verse:]  
When I heard that you'd died  
I was stabbed inside  
I'll never be the same again  
I've lost a stranger yet I somehow lost a friend  
Even though I never knew you  
From the moment I heard I knew  
So short was the passage between life and death  
That I needed some time to take a breath  
So young girl this song's for you  
And your life lost, so young, so new  
And you never realised  
That so many would lose their sleep tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
So don't tell me  
Not to cry  
'cause I'm hurting  
Inside, outside  
Young girl, you're to young to die  
I heard your ambition's high  
Now look me in the eye  
And tell me that I shouldn't cry  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I was there from the start  
When I heard, I gave my heart  
I can't connect how I feel  
With what happened, or what's real  
You felt the fear and then the blow  
You couldn't say goodbye before you go  
I can't sweep aside what I feel  
I can't sweep aside, it's so real  
The cruel world let you die  
So why do I feel like I shouldn't cry  
I was choked up inside  
The day that you died  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm feeling like I've got no right  
When there's others who won't sleep for nights  
I'm feeling like I'm daft to feel this way  
But I can't hold it back another day  
These tears, this song's for you  
There's nothing I wouldn't do  
To let you know I care  
But a stab to my heart unprepared  
Left me feeling outta life  
The day that you died  
  
[Chorus][x2]  
  
Every time I read those words  
My heart gives in  
I'll never get over it  
It won't kick in  
That you're gone  
I'm sorry that you're gone

And pirate ships of old  
Filled with diamonds and with gold

And pure harmony  
Magical mirrors reflecting the light

Deeper and deeper you fall in a trance  
Much more real  
Much more real than it seems

Straddled that Greyhound and rode it into Raleigh and on across Caroline.  
We stopped in Charlotte but we bypassed Rockhill, we never was a minute late.  
We were ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown rolling out of Georgia state.  
Had some motor trouble that turned into a struggle half way across Alabam.  
That hound broke and left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham.  
So right away I bought me a through train ticket right across Mississippi
clean,  
And I was on that Special Flyer out of Birmingham smoking into New Orleans.  
Someone's got to help me get out of Louisiana, just to help me get to Houston
town.  
There's an uncle there who cares a little about me and he won't let the poor
boy down.  
Sure as you're born, he bought me a silk suit, put some luggage in my hand.  
And I woke up high over Albuquerque on a jet to the Promised Land.  
Working on a T-Bone steak, a la carte, flying over to the Golden State.  
When the pilot told us that in thirteen minutes he would have us at the
terminal gate.  
Swing down chariot, come down easy, taxi to the terminal dome.  
Cut your engines and cool your wings and let me make it to the telephone.  
Los Angeles give me Norfolk, Virginia, tidewater four-ten-O-nine.  
Tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land calling,

Losin' my mind  
Goodbye

I gotta say goodbye  
This isn't easy  
I gotta say goodbye

Frank Sinatra,Cycles,/f/frank+sinatra/cycles_20056468.html,"So I'm down and so I'm out  
But so are many others  
So I feel like tryin' to hide  
My head 'neath these covers  
  
Life is like the seasons  
After winter comes the spring  
So I'll keep this smile awhile  
And see what tomorrow brings  
  
I've been told and I believe  
That life is meant for livin'  
And even when my chips are low  
There's still some left for givin'  
  
I've been many places  
Maybe not as far as you  
So I think I'll stay awhile  
And see if some dreams come true  
  
There isn't much that I have learned  
Through all my foolish years  
Except that life keeps runnin' in cycles  
First there's laughter, then those tears  
  
But I'll keep my head up high  
Although I'm kinda tired  
My gal just up and left last week  
Friday I got fired  
  
You know it's almost funny  
But things can't get worse than now  
So I'll keep on tryin' to sing  
But please, just don't ask me how

No more nice time, bright boy shoe shines  
Pie in the sky dreams

Hold 'em tight till the end  
Better now you know we'll never  
Wait till tomorrow

Hold 'em tight till the end

Heaven help those who help themselves  
That's the way it goes  
The frightening thoughts of what's been taught  
And now it shows  
  
You keep coming, there's no running  
Tried a thousand times  
Under your feet grass is growing  
Time we said goodbye

Randy Travis,Shopping For Dresses,/r/randy+travis/shopping+for+dresses+feat+loretta+lynn_20217677.html,"Down through the ages men have died for women  
And done so for many times  
Each time I loved one, I've always lost one  
Seems the right one is so hard to find  
  
[Chorus:]  
Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them  
One in each color, one in each style  
I'll find a lady someday to wear them  
My shopping will be done for awhile  
  
I'll bet somewhere's a lady shopping for britches  
Comparing the value, appraising each pair  
Maybe someday the Lord will bring us together  
And we ll both have a new wardrobe to wear  
  
Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them  
One in each color and one in each style  
Maybe someday if I'm lucky  
I'll find someone to wear them  
And my shopping will be done for awhile  
My shopping will be done for awhile  
  
I'm looking for a lady who'll look good in dresses  
She must be red-headed, green eyes and be fair  
I'll make exceptions to all my requirements  
As long as she s willing to care  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I just saw a beauty with blue eyes, what a cutie  
Bond hair like a halo around her did flow  
But the brunette beside her would be just as lovely  
In the dresses I bought long ago  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now as I sit here dreaming, planning and scheming  
Why should I make standards when everyone knows  
As your need ranges, women make changes  
And you must accept them or just let them go

That wealth has set apart  
For the Christ who has not risen,  
From the caverns of the heart

For what's left of our religion,

I'd meet you at the store,  
But I can't buy it, baby.  
I can't buy it anymore.

Ed Sheeran,Everything Has Changed,/e/ed+sheeran/everything+has+changed_21048640.html,"[Taylor Swift]  
I use to think that love was for dreamers,  
""Love at first sight"" I never believed it,  
Had my head on tight, I lived in the real world,  
But that was until I met you.  
Now everything is changed.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
Yesterday I was drinking my sorrows away,  
On the edge of forever storing my heart away,  
On the verge of letting my heart go stray.  
And that's when I met you.  
And now everything is changed.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
Oh darling,  
You look like your soul is lost.  
What could've happened to make you feel so low?  
Don't let the liquor ease your hurt.  
Don't let your heart go cold.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
Oh darling,  
Don't worry, I'll be just fine.  
What's a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this?  
If I weren't drinking then I'd be crying,  
And I think that's something we both rather miss.  
  
[Both]  
But I guess that's just how the cookie crumbles,  
You give your all and watch as your heart tumbles  
Down and down until you can't feel anymore.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
That's the thing about love,  
That's the reason why I'll never fall again,  
It hurts when it's supposed to make you make you feel good.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
Well if that's what love is,  
Then I don't ever wanna try it out,  
But something tells me I should.  
  
Even though we've only met each other,  
We'll work it out together until everything is changed.  
Until everything is good.

You must forgive me  
If I'm up and going to carolina in my mind  
  
In my mind I'm going to carolina  
Can't you see the sunshine  
Can't you just feel the moon shining  
Aint it just like a friend of mine  
To hit me from behind  
And I'm going to carolina in my mind  
Going to carolina in my mind  
Going to carolina in my mind

Perry Como,As Time Goes By,/p/perry+como/as+time+goes+by_20106842.html,"You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things apply,  
As time goes by  
  
An' when two lovers woo, they still say ""I love you,""  
On that you can rely, no matter what the future brings,  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight an' love songs never out of date,  
Hearts full of passion, jealousy an' hate,  
Woman needs man and man must have his mate,  
That no one can deny  
  
It's still the same old story, a fight for love an' glory,  
A case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers,  
As time goes by  
  
It's still the same old story, a fight for love an' glory,  
A case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers,

A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's going to rain today  
  
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles  
With frozen smiles to chase love away  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's going to rain today  
  
Lonely, lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
Think I'll kick it down the street  
That's the way to treat a friend  
  
Bright before me the signs implore me  
To help the needy and show them the way  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's going to rain today

Stolen from myself the most

And then just when she thinks that I've got her number  
Brings me down to the ground with her wintry eye  
That's my baby  
She can be all four seasons in one day  
  
And when the nighttime comes with no interference  
To our warm summer love with all its charms  
But like a thoroughbred horse she can turn on a sixpence  
And I find that I'm back in Mistress Winter's arms

How can I tell?  
Which side of the bed she takes when the day begins  
She can be kind  
She can be cruel  
She's got me guessing like a game show fool  
  
She can change her mind like she changes her sweaters  
From one minute to the next it's hard to tell  
She blows hot and cold just like stormy weather  
She's my gift from the Lord or a fiend from hell  
That's my baby  
She can be all four seasons in one day  
  
Watching the weatherman's been no good at all  
Winter, spring, summer, I'm bound for a fall  
There are no long term predictions for my baby  
She can be all four seasons in one day  
  
How will I know?  
How can I tell?  
Which side of the bed she takes when the day begins  
She can be kind  
She can be cruel  
She's got me guessing like a game show fool  
  
If it's a sunny day I take my umbrella  
Just in case the raindrops start to fall  
You could say that I'm just a cautious fellow  
I don't want to be caught in a sudden squall

She can be all four seasons in one day

Songs were sung and tales were told, life was like a dream

Ever since those gallant heroes gone

Falling down I said, falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
  
Noted for diplomacy, once the mighty fall  
Touching pmp of pageantry, history books all show  
Husky dogs and great explorers  
Mighty kings and sage warriors  
Trouble take me since they're dead and gone

Falling down I said, falling down

In the eyes of god we must be wrong

Falling down I said, falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down

France and Spain were just the same if the truth be known  
Now the walls are down in Europe  
Forming laws with certain Arabs?  
Better get your petrol while you can

Now we pay to advertise while we sell the lot

I wanna get away, get away (Into the void)  
I'm bein' pulled, I'm bein' pulled down (Into the void)  
This place is spinnin', spinnin' around (Into the void)  
Fell like I'm bein' pulled into a black hole  
This crazy feelin's screwin' with my head  
I'm overloadin' and my gauges are red  
State of confusion's got a hold on me  
I feel a hesitation  
I'm bein' drugged, fallen out of the track  
Don't like the situation  
Caught like a magnet and I'm bein' pulled (Into the void)  
I wanna get away, get away (Into the void)  
My head is spinnin', spinnin' around 'round (Into the void)  
This force is gettin', gettin' stronger (Into the void)  
Fell like I'm bein' pulled into a black hole (Into the void)  
I'm bein' pulled, bein' pulled down down  
Down down  
I wanna really get away (Into the void)  
Don't like this feelin', I'm bein' pulled down (Into the void)  
I wanna get away, get away (Into the void)  
Feel like it's spinnin', spinnin' around (Into the void)  
I'm being pulled, bein' pulled down down  
Down down (Into the void)  
Get away, get away (Into the void)

It tells me what the angels and lovers said  
This desire  
Is not ordinary  
Love is screaming at you  
  
If the moon should turn red over your head don't let her go  
Just believe it's your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find  
  
You find a love like this once in your life  
A diamond in your hand not a piece of glass  
Picture you  
Looking back on what you've  
Done to lose all this time  
  
If the moon should turn red over your head don't let her go  
If the sea should turn dry don't let him fly don't say goodbye  
If the planets collide don't run and hide change his mind  
Just believe it's your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find

We'll speak of what a waste I am and how  
We missed your beat again  
  
I swear we need to find some comfort in  
This run down place  
To bridge the gap of this conscious state  
That we live in  
I'm short on time  
  
How come you try and fit the shape of  
What they tell you  
  
But mostly what they show you  
That brings us home  
I pray for you to move on  
  
At this rate we can't keep up but I sure  
Can't just sit still  
I'm taking back all the things I said  
Keep me filled in, I swear I'll come  
  
We walk alone back home  
  
You're almost gone and I'm ok to give you  
Time to be afraid  
I still see your shadow but never your face again  
I remember your presence  
  
I hope to God you come down  
I hope to God you can feel this now  
  
I know there must be some way out of  
Here and all of them will be waiting there

P!nk,Heartbreaker,/p/pnk/heartbreaker_20479959.html,"I keep thinkin' bout that little sparkle in your eye  
Is it a light from the angels, or your devil deep inside?  
What about the way you say you love me all the time  
Are you liftin' me up to heaven just to drop me down the line?  
There's a ring around my finger, but will you change your mind?  
And you tell me that I'm beautiful but that could be lie  
Are you a heartbreaker  
Maybe you want me for the ride  
What if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker and everything is just a lie  
I wont be leavin' here alive  
I wont be leavin' here alive, no  
Temporary happiness is like waiting for the knife  
Cause I'm always watchin' for someone to show their darker side  
So maybe I'll sit back and just enjoy all this for now  
Watch it all play out see if you really stick around  
But there's always this one question that keeps me up at night  
Are you my greatest love or disappointment in my life  
Are you a heartbreaker maybe you want me for the ride what if I'm fallin' for
a heartbreaker and everything is just a lie  
I wont be leaving here alive  
I might as well lay down and die  
I'm holding on with both hands and both feet ooohhhh  
Promise that you won't pull the rug out from under me  
Are you a heartbreaker maybe you want me for the ride  
I pray to god you're not a heartbreaker  
This time around I wont survive cause if I've fallin' for a heartbreaker  
And everything is just a lie  
I wont be leaving here alive  
I might as well lay down and die  
I wont be leaving here alive

And you're wearing make up and perfume  
In the gallows you were hung  
But now I see you walk instead

He'll never ever die  
Well you kept your secrets  
And locked them up  
Then drained their blood  
As you read your books  
See the show and rink from your cup  
And then hang your darlings  
From the hooks  
Slice them up, no one will ever know  
But still you smell that smell  
And now you're dead since long ago  
You better burn in hell

Like a coin that won't get tossed  
Rolling home to you.

Lullabies, look in your eyes,  
Run around the same old town.  
It doesn't mean that much to me  
To mean that much to you.  
  
I've been first and last  
Look at how the time goes past.  
But I'm all alone at last.  
Rolling home to you.

Standing by you I have seen so much  
Ain't it funny how I found the one  
But you pull back to protect a heart born to run  
Passion begs you to oblige them all  
Love escapes you and you watch them fall  
Giving nothing you are left to bleed  
Will you ever recognize I know what you need  
  
I want to hold you tight  
Give you the rest of my life  
You are my heaven  
The river flows to the sea  
Like you could reach out to me  
But I can get in  
Till you let your heart win  
  
Dressed in silence  
To disguise the pain  
Pure emotion doesn't know your name  
Love still haunts you  
Please don't turn away  
I'm with you if you care  
Oh you know, things will change

Bosson,Hard Candy,/b/bosson/hard+candy_20643607.html,"On certain Sundays in November,  
When the whether bothers me,  
I empty draws of other summers,  
Where my shadows used to be,  
She is standing by the water,  
As her smile begins to curl,  
In this or any other summer,  
She is something all together different,  
Never just an ordanairy girl.  
And in the evenings on Long Island,  
When the colours start to fade,  
She wears a silly yellow hat,  
That someone gave her when she stayed,  
I didn't think that she returned it,  
We left New York in a whirl,  
Time expands and then contracts,  
When you are spinning in the grips of someone,  
Who is not an ordanairy girl.  
And when you sleep, you find your mother in the night,  
But she fades just out of sight,  
So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming,  
And when you wake, the morning covers you with light,  
And it makes you feel alright,  
But its just the same hard candy your remembering again.  
You send your lover off to China,  
Then you awit for her to call,  
You put your girl upon a pedestal,  
And you wait fro her to fall,  
I put my summers back in a letter,  
And I hide it from the world,  
All the regrets you can't forget,  
Are somehow pressed upon the picture,  
In the face of such an ordanairy girl.  
And when you sleep,  
You find your mother in the night,  
But she fades just out of sight,  
So there isn't any sweetness in thee dreaming,  
And when you wake, the morning showers you with light,  
But its just the same hard candy, your remembering again,  
Again, again, again, again.  
And its just the same hard candy your remembering again.  
  
Go ask her to come around,  
And see me late, after dark,  
Don't ask me to go around,  
And wait to see if theres a spark X2

Don't tell me that we're through  
Don't tell me that it's over  
Don't try and tell me that it's over  
It isn't true  
Don't tell me that it's over  
'Cause you can't say goodbye any more  
Than I can walk away from you  
  
You say it's hard to love a man like me  
But, baby, now and then  
You do your fair share so easily  
You can push me to my limit  
And back again  
  
Just when I can't take anymore  
And I've made up my mind  
I say I'm ready to walk out the door  
But somethin' keeps me from leavin' you behind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a reason why  
After we've tried  
We're not runnin' to the arms of another  
  
When all comes down  
We both know by now  
We just still mean too much to each other  
  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me it's over

Richard Marx,Now And Forever,/r/richard+marx/now+forever_20116038.html,"Whenever I'm weary from the battles that rage in my head  
You make sense of madness when my sanity hangs by a thread  
I lose my way but still you seem to understand  
Now and forever I will be your man.  
  
Sometimes I just hold you  
Too caught up in me to see  
I'm holding a fortune that heaven has given to me  
I'll try to show you each and every way I can  
Now and forever I will be your man  
  
Now I can rest my worries and always be sure  
That I won't be alone anymore  
If I'd only known you were there all the time  
All this time  
  
Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand  
Now and forever I will be your man  
Now and forever I will be your man

A sordid truth

To guide our hearts  
We'll never find  
What we deserve

She waited for so long  
  
She'd pretend  
Thant she cared  
Invent some tale  
Just to gain his heart  
But no more dreams  
She didn't dare  
She washed her hands  
Of this whole affair  
  
She's leaving  
She waited for so long  
  
But as she left  
She gave her heart  
Abandoned hope  
And turned for home

But then again  
The more we learn  
The less we know

We'd have to move along

Too soon the times we share form part of yesterday  
'Cause life's a constant change  
And nothing stays the same, oh no  
  
Clouds that move across the skies  
Are changing form before our very eyes  
  
Why couldn't we keep time from movin' on?  
Hold on to all the years before this moment's gone?  
Why must we live the days at such a frightening pace?  
  
We're all like clouds that move across the skies  
And changing form before our very eyes  
  
Have we outgrown our Peter Pans and wings?  
We've simply grown too old for tales of knights and kings  
'Cause life's a constant change  
And nothing stays the same, oh no

The one and only

To get inside the minds  
Of every legend I've ever wanted to stand beside  
It's like an endless ride  
Feeling the lows and highs  
Of every lyric and melody  
Every single rhyme  
So here I stand today  
In tribute I do pay  
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way  
And so to God I pray that he will give me strength  
To carry forward the gift of song in his good faith  
In his good faith  
  
I'm going back to basics  
To where it all began  
I'm ready now to face it  
I wanna understand  
What made the soul singers  
And the blues figures  
That inspired a higher generation  
The jazz makers, and the ground breakers  
They gave so much of themselves and dedication  
  
So here I stand today  
In tribute I do pay  
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way

Train,Son Of A Prison Guard,/t/train/son+of+a+prison+guard_21087675.html,"There was a mountain on the table of bills that needed paid  
Dishes in the kitchen sink like dreams that never fade  
A wild imagination of convicts in the yard  
Never enough time to make ends meet  
So they put it on a credit card, don't we all?  
  
You may not know just where you came from, but once upon a time  
There was a carpenter, a bartender, a broken fishing line  
Just south of Royal Teeth in the town that I came from  
There were architects and astronauts  
But the only one she loved was a prison guard  
  
And that's the only time I ever saw true love  
  
And Erica's a girl I liked in Georgia  
Alone and kept me warm in Eugene  
I guess my mother bless her heart  
Set the bar too high to start  
What's fine enough to me is just too hard  
For a son of a prison guard  
  
There's a gate that needed painting, clothes that needed clean  
They'd say there's time enough for that when the fun has all been seen  
Cause when we're laying on our death bed, a promise we won't say  
Wish we would have worked more, baby  
Instead of loving you that way, no way  
  
And that's the only time I ever saw true love  
  
Sedona is a girl I met in Brooklyn  
Herris got me close in New Orleans  
I guess my mother bless her heart  
Set the bar too high to start  
What's fine enough to me is just too hard  
For a son of a prison guard  
  
I go wherever you are, whoever you are  
I go wherever you are, whoever you are  
I go wherever you are, whoever you are  
I go wherever you are  
  
Betty is a girl I knew in Charlotte  
... left for Sydney yesterday  
I guess my mother bless her heart  
Set the bar too high to start  
What's fine enough to me is just too hard

Whoever you are

And sleep is what you'll get  
So far away from that sweet baby child  
Who hardly knew you yet  
  
Now he'll grow up to be a fighter  
Full of anger, full of shame  
Like all the other haunted children  
Who wonder why they came  
And he'll be in and out of trouble  
Until he stands up or he falls  
But there will always be a shadow there

Much more constructively than that

Of some puffed up little fart  
Doing exactly what I used to do  
Pretensions to anarchy and art

He mounts his misinformed attack  
He wears the clothes of a dissenter  
But there's a logo on his back  
And it's a hollow rebellion  
As rebellions mostly are  
It's just another raging tempest in a jar  
  
And the seasons keep on changing  
And the wind blows hot and cold  
Wish that you were here with us to watch this tide  
As it ebbs and flows

Hopin' that they all move on me.  
Word, for REAL for real.  
Do it hard for the love of the game.  
Pull your card and I'm askin' yo' name, bitch.  
Jay-Dee be champion.  
Tip be stylin' and definin' yo' chick, best compan-ion.  
I'd advise you to fix your self, for real,  
And do your shit wit' more zeal. (""More zeal."")  
We in the mix and it's thickenin',  
My rhyme and it's tickin' in.  
The hatin' and the shit is so sickenin'.  
Picasso, original. (""'Riginal."")  
You forg-azy and the shit amaze me.  
Sharpen your contrast and put a little color in it.  
High Define your screen and put this brotha in it.

Rush,Caravan,/r/rush/caravan_21015138.html,"In a world lit only by fire  
Long train of flares under piercing stars  
I stand watching the steamliners roll by  
  
The caravan thunders onward  
To the distant dream of the city  
The caravan carries me onward  
On my way at last  
On my way at last  
  
I can't stop thinking big  
I can't stop thinking big  
  
On a road lit only by fire  
Going where I want, instead of where I should  
I peer out at the passing shadows  
Carried through the night into the city  
Where a young man has a chance of making good  
A chance to break from the past  
The caravan thunders onward  
Stars winking through the canvas hood  
On my way at last

As he drove away on that rainy night,  
I begged him to go slow, whether he heard,

I felt so helpless, what could I do  
Remembering all the things we'd been through?  
In school they all stop and stare

And the storm I walk toward  
When all around is madness  
And there's no safe port in view  
I long to turn my path homeward  
To stop awhile with you.  
When life becomes as barren  
And as cold winter skies  
There's a beacon in the darkness  
In a distant pair of eyes  
In vain to search for honor  
And in vain to search for truth  
But these things can still be given  
Your love has shown me proof.

Banged on my knees on your back door  
Only to wake you to blues on the way  
Blues on the way

Figures you'll see me as older  
Twenty-three hours till the border  
Don't think I'll be going as fast as I came  
Fast as I came  
Fast as I came  
  
Tears on my pillow  
Of course they're not mine  
Alter that altar  
Making a play  
Somebody invent the telephone line  
I'll take mine  
My chances

Wish I could do what gold does  
Heard that the stars were in order  
Got yourself dealt a hand with  
Two queen of spades  
And blues on the way

Tears on my pillow  
Of course they're not mine  
Alter that altar  
Making a play  
Somebody, just somebody, invent the telephone line

Uriah Heep,In The Moment,/u/uriah+heep/in+the+moment_20142463.html,"Here we are  
Once more in a world full of fantasy  
Dream again  
You need to believe in a future  
That's bright as the sun  
Shining there for you  
Shining there for me  
I am the mountain high, I am the sea  
In the moment you take possession  
It'll all disappear and there's the lesson  
And the minute you think it's over  
Say the word and your dream  
Is coming back  
All the way  
I followed the road that was real to me  
And suddenly  
You take it for granted  
And things don't turn out  
Like you planned  
When you think you've found  
What is good and true  
Through the open door  
It can really turn on you  
So here we are  
We look for the light in so many eyes  
And in our life  
When hope starts to fade  
There's a strength that  
We give to each other  
Walking in the sky over everyone  
Head above the coulds  
As we're touching the sun  

"
Nick Cave,Messiah Ward,/n/nick+cave/messiah+ward_20483133.html,"I hope you're sitting comfortably  
I saved you the best seat in the house  
Right up in the front row  
The stars have been torn down  
The moon is locked away  
And the land is banked in frozen snow  
  
You are a forte of nature, dear  
Your breath curls from your lips  
As the trees bend down their branches  
And touch you with their fingertips  
They're bringing out the dead now  
It's easy just to look away  
They are bringing out the dead now  
It's been a strange, strange day  
  
We could navigate out position by the stars  
But they've taken out the stars  
The stars have all gone  
I'm glad you've come along  
We could comprehend our  
Condition by the moon  
But they've ordered the the moon not to shine  
Still, I 'm glad you've come along  
I was worried out of my mind  
Cause, they keep bringing out the dead  
It's easy just to look away  
They're bringing out the dead, now  
And it's been a long, strange day  
  
You can move up a little closer  
I will throw a blanket over  
We can weigh all the tears in one hand  
Against the laughter in the other  
We could be hanging around here for centuries  
Trying to make sense of this, my dear  
While the planets try to get organised  
Way above the stratosphere  
But they keep bringing out the dead, now  
It's easy if we just walk away  
They keep bringing out the dead, now  
It's been a long, long day  
  
Look away  
Look away

Aerosmith,Avant Garden,/a/aerosmith/avant+garden_20004299.html,"I had a friend who spoke of fate  
And he knew of another place in space and time  
He told of how me and my lady  
Could look but we would never find  
Said if you please I beg your pardon  
Sometimes the things you see they just ain't so  
Your life can be an avant garden  
Cause love's what makes your garden grow  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
We won't be denied  
Here inside our avant garden  
Sometimes my life ain't what it's seemin'  
Right from the start it's what your heart's believin'  
Could all this just be lucid dreamin'  
But dreams just ain't enough for me  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
We won't be denied  
Here inside our avant garden  
You know it just ain't right  
To deal with other's shite  
No one should ever be so broken hearted  
Don't never be afraid  
Cause when you got it made  
Yeah you don't even have to try  
So I'll be waiting in your garden  
Ffff...watching all your flowers grow  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
You'll know we've arrived  
Here inside our avant garden...yeah yeah  
The sun brings the rain  
The moon needs the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
Beware of the lies  
A word to the wise  
There's sweet cherry pies  
And truth inside our avant garden...ooh ah yea  
Do it do it  
Do it do it...  
You can spend your whole lifetime  
Under my skin  
You can be never more mine  
Under my skin

This dance will be endin'  
And you're gonna be missed

Where we slang rocks that claim blocks  
And those red and blue lights just keep our streets hot  
  
C'mon and ride with a nigga  
so I can show you what Dade County really got  
See don't be fooled by South Beach  
Thinking when you come to the Bottom  
You can just run these streets  
You and your jewels are like a menu  
And trust me nigga we intend to eat  
  
Fuck around and cross that I-Three Ninety Five  
You just run into a bunch of dead end streets  
Niggas with wife-beaters and bare feet  
That's right, I'm talking straight goon style  
Go beyond that about three miles  
and you're now entering the infamous Lil Havana  
Now I know yall studio gangsters be vibing off the movie Scarface  
But the wrong move in this place,  
you'll fuck around and meet the real Tony Montana  
  
So fuck them palm trees  
I got shit for you to really see  
Like there's a graveyard with bury sub  
With niggas buried four generations deep  
And I aint even talking about sister lined next to brother  
I'm talking granddaddy to grandmother piled up on top of each other  
And all that rap about your Lil Haiti connections?  
Nigga you don't even know a real zoo  
But I can introduce you to one that'll kick in your door  
Put you faced down on the floor  
And have your whole family wiring money from Chicago  
  
But you a star, though  
Okay, nigga if you a real G  
This is where you tell your car to go  
  
Opa Locka  
Where there is continuous spotlight  
helicopters and a triangle full of choppers  
Carol City will make holes in you so big,  
They can't be plugged by doctors  
  
Nigga, this is the real Dade County  
Where we are soldiers from birth to the hearse  
That's why my childhood consisted of a bulletproof vest and a Pyrex  
Nigga, you haven't even seen the real Miami, yet  
So Welcome to Miami Dade County, the real Miami  
Where we live and die, for life

Sold my coat when I hit Spokane  
Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes in the early  
Morning rain  
Lately my hands they don't feel like mine  
My eyes been stung with dust and blind  
Held you in my arms one time  
Lost you just the same

I ain't about to go straight  
It's too late  
I found myself face down in a ditch  
Booze in my hair  
Blood in my lips  
A picture of you holding a picture of me  
In the pocket of my blue jeans  
Still don't know what love means  
Still don't know what love means  
Jolene  
  
Been so long since I seen your face  
Or felt a part of this human race  
I've been living out of this here suitcase for way too long  
A man needs something he can hold onto  
A nine pound hammer or a woman like you  
Either one of them things will do

Tina Turner,We Don't Need Another Hero,/t/tina+turner/we+dont+need+another+hero_10232469.html,"Out of the ruins, out from the wreckage  
Can't make the same mistakes this time  
We are the children, the last generation  
We are the ones they left behind  
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change?  
Living under the fear, till nothing else remains  
  
We don't need another hero,  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome  
  
Looking for something we can rely on  
There's got to be something better out there.  
Mmmm, love and compassion, their day is coming  
All else are castles built in the air  
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change?  
Living under the fear, till nothing else remains.  
  
All the children say,  
We don't need another hero,  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome  
  
So what do we do with our lives?  
We leave only a mark.  
Will our story shine like a light,  
Or end in the dark?  
Give it all or nothing!  
  
We don't need another hero,  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome  
  
All the children say,  
We don't need another hero,  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome

HIM,Dying Song,/h/him/dying+song_20871023.html,"I've seen you breathe life into the weakest of hearts,  
And heard you scream out loud the sweetest poem,  
Echoing across the ocean reminding me why I still try  
To hold onto whatever is left of you and I.  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song,  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more,  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life.  
  
I've seen these dreams being crushed by a single thought,  
And felt the envy of sadness engulf all warmth  
Barely alive under ice by exchanging sighs,  
With tomorrow quivering in the loneliest light,  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song,  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life and love,  
Life and love with you  
  
Crawl back into bed tomorrow's trembling at the sight of you and I.  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life and love,  
Life and love,  
Life and love (dying song)  
Life and love (a dying song)  
With you (a dying song)  
With you (dying song)  
With you (dying song)

Snowflakes in the air  
Carols everywhere  
Olden times and ancient rhymes  
Of love and dreams to share  
  
Sleigh bells in the air  
Beauty everywhere  
Yuletide by the fireside  
And joyful memories there  
  
Christmas time is here  
We'll be drawing near  
Oh, that we could always see  
Such spirit through the year  
Oh, that we could always see  
Such spirit through the year

Blazing 'cross the evening sky  
Gone too soon  
  
Like a rainbow  
Fading in the twinkling of an eye  
Gone too soon  
  
Shiny and sparkly  
And splendidly bright  
Here one day  
Gone one night  
  
Like the loss of sunlight  
On a cloudy afternoon  
Gone too soon  
  
Like a castle  
Built upon a sandy beach  
Gone too soon  
  
Like a perfect flower  
That is just beyond your reach  
Gone too soon  
  
Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight  
Here one day  
Gone one night  
  
Like a sunset  
Dying with the rising of the moon  
Gone too soon  
  
Gone too soon

Pink Floyd,Wish You Were Here,/p/pink+floyd/wish+you+were+here_20108843.html,"So, so you think you can tell  
Heaven from Hell,  
Blue skies from pain.  
Can you tell a green field  
From a cold steel rail?  
A smile from a veil?  
Do you think you can tell?  
  
And did they get you to trade  
Your heroes for ghosts?  
Hot ashes for trees?  
Hot air for a cool breeze?  
Cold comfort for change?  
And did you exchange  
A walk on part in the war  
For a lead role in a cage?  
  
How I wish, how I wish you were here.  
We're just two lost souls  
Swimming in a fish bowl,  
Year after year,  
Running over the same old ground.  
And how we found  
The same old fears.  
Wish you were here.

Jackson Browne,Someday Morning,/j/jackson+browne/someday+morning_20068681.html,"As the early morning filters through  
My shuttered window pane  
I look about and realize  
That things are still the same  
  
These flowers in a glass  
Mark the hours that have passed  
As I lay sleeping  
  
And I can hear my footsteps ringing  
Down the empty morning street  
And the concrete that I walk upon  
Is cold beneath my feet  
  
A single winging dove  
Reminds me of the sleeping love  
That I am leaving  
  
'cause everyone must someday do his own thing  
'cause everyone must someday do his own thing  
And I have a brand new song to sing  
  
In the morning skies the stars  
Begin to sputter and to fade  
As the night surrenders all it's claim  
On shadows it has made  
  
A watchdog's hungry bark  
Is the morning's first remark  
Upon my walking  
  
And everyone must someday do his own thing  
And everyone must someday do his own thing  
And I have a brand new song to sing  
  
And I'm told that if I try  
That I can do most anything  
Well then I would like to sing a song  
And make this morning ring  
  
As the morning turns to day  
Hear the waking city say  
Who is that singing

You can't catch her from behind

The Memphis train  
Sound like she leaves real soon  
Got nothin' to guide me  
'Cept the color of the moon  
Hangin' over Memphis  
  
Headed down  
Where the Mississippi runs  
Boys I'm headed home  
Back where the Mississippi runs  
I hear there's some lovin' there  
Try to get me some  
  
Headed down to Memphis

I'm gettin' on that train, man,  
I ain't even gonna call  
Be there 'fore the break of day

But we weren't alright, not at all  
Not for one second  
  
Never have been one to write it down  
Now I think I can  
I know I'm stronger now  
Who's looking south  
Not me I'm not looking back  
I'm done denying the truth to anyone  
Cause I'm alive  
  
You showed me how  
You seemed to find a hole  
But I just laughed and smiled  
Begged and rolled my eyes  
Even cried and  
Denied the truth to you  
Just like the truth to me  
Mostly lied  
  
I'm not going to look back  
  
White it out like glittering wax butterflies

Soft in your arms, I hear the words begin  
They promise this time the melody won't end  
Here comes that song again  
  
There's a tender song inside me  
Only your sweet voice can play  
I heard it once but it disappeared  
On the day you went away  
  
As time slipped by  
I thought that I'd forgotten all the lines  
But then last night we met again  
And I heard them one more time  
  
Here comes that song again  
Soft in your arms, I hear the words begin  
They promise this time the melody won't end  
Here comes that song again  
  
With the early mornin' raindrops  
Dancin' on my window pane  
You hold me and I hear my song  
Keepin' time with the fallin' rain  
  
Now, I don't know what made you go  
Or brought you back last night  
I only know my love for you  
Is a song that feels so right  
  
Here comes that song again  
Soft in your arms, I hear the words begin  
They promise this time the melody won't end  
Here comes that song again

Emmylou Harris,For A Dancer,/e/emmylou+harris/for+a+dancer_20504425.html,"Keep the fire burning in your eyes  
Pay attention to the open sky  
You'll never know what will be coming down  
I don't remember losing track of you  
You're always dancing in and out of view  
I must have thought you would always be around  
Always keeping things real by playing the clown  
Now you're nowhere to be found  
I don't know what happens when people die  
Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try  
It's like a song I can hear playing right in my ear  
But I can't sing, I can't help listening  
I can't help feeling stupid standing around  
Crying is the easier down  
'Cause I know that you would rather we'd be dancing  
Dancing our sorrow away  
No matter what fate throws in your way  
Just do the steps that you've been shown  
By everyone you've ever known  
Until the dance becomes your very own  
No matter how close to yours  
Another's steps have grown  
In the end there is one dance you'll do alone  
Keep a fire for the human race  
Let your prayers go drifting into space  
You'll never know what will be coming down  
Perhaps a better world is drawing near  
Just as easy it could all disappear  
Along with whatever meaning you might have found  
Don't let the uncertainty turn you around  
Go on and make a joyful sound  
Into a dancer you have grown  
From a seed somebody else has thrown  
Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own  
And somewhere between the time you arrive  
The time you go may lie a reason you were alive  
But you'll never know

We said we needed space  
But all we found was an empty place  
And the only things I learned  
Is that I need you desperately  
  
So here I am  
And can you please tell me, oh

Won't they always love you

And I know that you still care, for me

That dreams don't turn to gold  
And that there is no easy way  
No you just can't run away  
And what we have is so much more  
Than we ever had before  
And no matter how I try  
You're always on my mind

Back to the open arms  
Of a love that's waiting there

Hanson,World's On Fire,/h/hanson/worlds+on+fire_20874772.html,"Watched from a distance, it's beautiful  
Somebody's caught in the undertow  
Have you ever felt desperation?  
The saltwater's filling your lungs  
We will regret it when we sleep  
Promises never meant to keep  
When all of the shadows need  
Is a good man to hide in the dream  
Do they know that the world's on fire?  
  
Time is a price we can't afford  
An empty glass and an open door  
You get what you paid for in sweat  
And a voice that says please don't forget  
  
Do they know that the world's on fire?  
Do they know that the time is now?  
Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up  
Let your voice speak out  
Do they know that it's time?  
  
Caught in a maze you can't escape  
The flickering lights, and the colored lens  
The walls that we build just close in  
Until we decide to begin  
Are we distracted by the sun?  
The glittering jewels, and the beating drums  
Is it going the distance we fear?  
Have you heard that we're already here?  
  
Do they know that the world's on fire?  
Do they know that the time is now?  
Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up  
Let your voice speak out  
Do they know that the world's on fire?  
Do they know that the time is here?  
Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up  
Let your voice be clear  
Do they know that it's time?  
  
Some will say we've gone too far  
We're on the edge and in too deep  
Some will say we're too far gone  
You can't erase the tragedy

Play me loud don't you worry 'bout your nieghbors  
Hope I make you feel good all day long  
All day long  
  
Put me on and play me loud

I'll soon be coming to your town  
To sing and play a little tune  
  
I said put me on and play me loud  
Turn your stereo up all the way  
All the way  
Now your body's immersed in sound  
So hear the synthesizers play  
  
And now you're in the mood  
Let the melody just drift your cares away  
It's got to do you good  
As it mesmerizes you in its own way  
So drift away

Dire Straits,Industrial Disease,/d/dire+straits/industrial+disease_20040724.html,"Now warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control  
Somebody threw a spanner and they threw it in a hole  
There's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town  
Somebody blew the whistle and the walls are closing down  
There's a meeting in the boardroom they're trying to trace the smell  
There's leaking in the washroom there's a stinking personnel  
Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze  
'Goodness me could this be Industrial Disease?  
  
The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post  
They're refusing to be pacified it's him they blame the most  
The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas  
And everyone's concerned about Industrial Disease  
There's panic on the switchboard tongues are in knots  
Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots  
Some blame the management some the employees  
Everybody knows it's the Industrial Disease  
  
The work force is disgusted downs tools and walks  
Innocence is injured experience just talks  
Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees  
That these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze'  
On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse  
Philosophy is useless, theology is worse  
History boils over there's an economics freeze  
  
Sociologists invent words that mean 'Industrial Disease'  
Doctor Parkinson declared 'I'm not surprised to see you here  
You've got smokers cough from smoking, brewer's droop from drinking beer  
I don't know how you came to get the Betty Davis ease  
But worst of all young man you've got Industrial Disease'  
  
He wrote me a prescription he said 'you are depressed  
But I'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chest  
Come back and see me later - next patient please  
Send in another victim of Industrial Disease'  
I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm thunderstruck  
They got free speech, tourists, police in trucks  
Two men say they're Jesus one of them must be wrong  
There's a protest singer singing a protest song - he says  
They want to have a war to keep their factories  
They want to have a war to keep us on our knees  
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese  
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease  
They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind  
They want to sap your energy, incarcerate your mind  
They give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three  
Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease'  
Meanwhile the first Jesus says 'I'd cure it soon  
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons'  
The other one's out on hunger strike he's dying by degrees  
How come Jesus gets Industrial Disease?

Without a warning,  
As I looked out, my thoughts returned to you,  
A noise in the city made the children run,  
And hide themselves away,  
And thunder boomed and lightning filled the sky.  
  
Looking from this window,  
A thousand rivers running past my door,  
Standing on an islane, looking for someone,  
Upon the shore,  
I can see it very clearly nothing's really changed,  
Then lightning strikes across an empty sky.

Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Will it wash away the lonely tears,  
  
With their brand new time transporter,  
They'll think maybe I fought to get away,  
But with all their great inventions,  
And all their good intentions, here I stay,  
Down on the corner where the sun had shone,  
The people gathered 'round,  
Then scattered as the raindrops hit the ground.  
  
Ooohh, the rain is falling

Will it wash away the lonely tears.

If it jiggles or switches, fuck and take pictures, now  
I'm livin in a two-point zone, and I'm still bumpin  
Call me in the clutch, ain't lost my touch

But you'll never see her and me, over currency  
Givin you the third degree, cause you got  
Too many broke bitches and you like bankin for a penny

Paul Simon,A Church Is Burning,/p/paul+simon/a+church+is+burning_20166962.html,"A church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying,  
""You can burn down my churches but I shall be free.""  
  
Three hooded men through the back road did creep  
Torches in their hands while the village lies asleep  
Down to the church where just hours before  
Voices were singing and hands were beating  
And saying I won't be a slave any more.  
  
And a church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying,  
""You can burn down my churches but I shall be free.""  
  
Three hooded men, their hands lit the spark  
Then they faded in the night and they vanished in the dark  
And in the cold light of morning there's nothing that remains  
But the ashes of a bible and can of kerosene.  
  
And a church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying,  
""You can burn down my churches but I shall be free.""  
  
A church is more than just timber and stone  
And freedom is a dark road when you're walking it alone  
But the future is now, and it's time to take a stand  
So the lost bells of freedom can ring out in my land.  
  
And a church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying  
""You can burn down our churches but I shall be free.""

Booted me and bruised and hurt me

I was wasting my time  
Looking for love  
Someone must look at me  
And see their sunlit dream  
  
I was wasting my time  
Praying for love  
For a love that never comes from  
Someone who does not exist and  
  
That's how people grow up  
That's how people grow up  
  
Let me live before I die  
Not me, not I!  
  
I was wasting my life  
Always thinking about myself  
Someone on the deathbed said  
""There are other sorrows too""  
  
I was driving my car  
I crashed and broke my spine  
So yes, there are things worse in life than  
Never being someone's sweetie

That's how people grow up  
  
As for me I'm o.k.

Is made out of stone-lies.  
O little girl the truth would be  
An axe in thee.  
O father look to your daughter  
Brick of grief and stricken morter.  
With this ring  
This silver hoop of wire  
I bind your maiden mainstream  
Just to keep you as a child.  
O say goodbye to the little girl tree.  
O you know that I must say goodbye  
To my little girl tree.  
How fast your candy bones  
Reached out for me.  
I must say goodbye to your brittle bones  
Crying out for me.  
O you know that I must say goodbye.  
O goodbye.  
Even though you will betray me  
The very minute that I leave.  
O say goodbye to the little girl tree.  
O Lord you know that I must say goodbye  
To that little girl tree.  
I rise up her girl-child lumps and slipping knots  
Into her laden boughs  
And amongst her roping limbs  
Like a swollen neck vein branching  
Into smaller lesser veins  
That must all just sing and say goodbye  
And let her blossom veils fly.  
Her velvet gown.  
Down down down.  
Down down down.  
Down down down and goodbye.  
For you know that I must say goodbye.  
To a rhythm softly tortured  
Of a motion back and forth.  
That's a rhythm sweetly tortured  
O that's the rhythm of the orchard.  
And you know that I must say goodbye  
To that little girl tree.  
O goodbye.  
Yes goodbye.  
For you know that I must die.  
Down down down.  
Down down down.  
Down down down and goodbye.

But nothin' is real, and no one can feel like you

But were they just passin' through  
Or did they look down, and see what you found was true

As the bright lights dim, and the night closes in

At the windows and walls

Nothing but time on her hands  
Most of her mornings  
Are spent in her dreams  
Or making her sad little plans  
  
Maybe she'll go to the corner today  
And pick up the new McCall's  
If just to escape for an hour  
From her windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
  
The clock on the mantel  
Chiming the hours  
Must be the loneliest sound  
She washes her dishes  
And waters her flowers  
And afterwards has to sit down  
  
Sometimes she still  
Can remember a child  
Playing with china dolls  
Now all that she's left  
Are these memories  
And windows and walls

Jesus, You are life to me  
And when I see Your face I'll know  
All the pain and tears will go  
To the bottom of the sea  
You'll forever be holy, holy  
Holy...[4x]  
Where earth and wind, and sky and sea  
Will never match Your majesty  
From where I stand, I'm crying out  
Jesus, You are life to me  
Holy...[8x]  
When all is fallen (You are life to me)  
When all is broken (You are life to me)  
When all is empty (You are life to me)  
Life to me, life to me  
Life to me...  
When I am fallen (You are life to me)

Aso at pusa giliw  
Sa piling mo ako ay masaya

Basta sa akin wag kang mawawala...

Aaminin ko minsan ako'y manhid  
Sana ay iyong naririnig  
Sa 'yong yakap ako'y nasasabik

Malamig man o mainit ang gabi  
Nais ko sanang iparating  
Na ikaw lamang ang aking iibigin

And crimson crystal beads... to beckon...

We'll put on the day  
There's a sun shower every second

There was milk and toast and honey  
And a bowl of oranges too  
And the light poured in like butterscotch  
And stuck to all my senses...  
  
Won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
And we'll talk in present tenses

I walk the floor and watch the door  
And in between I drink  
Black coffee  
Love's a hand me down brew  
I'll never know a Sunday  
In this weekday room  
I'm talking to the shadows  
From 1 o'clock til 4  
And lord, how slow the moments go  
When all I do is pour  
Black coffee  
Since the blues caught my eye  
I'm hanging out on Monday  
My Sunday dreams to dry  
Now a man is born to go a lovin'  
A woman's born to weep and fret  
To stay at home and tend her oven  
And drown her past regrets  
In coffee and cigarettes  
I'm moaning all the morning  
And mourning all the night  
And in between it's nicotine  
And not much heart to fight  
Black coffee  
Feelin' low as the ground  
It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby  
To maybe come around... around  
I'm waiting for my baby  
To maybe come around  
My nerves have gone to pieces  
My hair is turning gray  
All I do is drink black coffee  
Since my man's gone away

And I've been to bed with Jezebel  
And I found the well as deep  
And I'd trade in my ambitions  
For a warmer place to sleep  
  
Well I've seen the heart of darkness  
Read the writing on the wall  
And the voice out in the desert  
Was the voice out in the hall  
And once he called me Abel  
And once he called me Cain  
And for forty days and for forty nights  
I slept out in the rain  
  
Girl can you share your warm bed tonight  
I need to find a safe retreat  
Someplace where they can't see my eyes  
I need to find a warmer place to sleep  
  
Well I rested in the devils arms  
I've chased the hounds of hell  
I played truth or dare with the angels  
And as I fall as I can tell  
That a heart of gold ain't no better  
Than a heart torn from the street  
And I'd trade in my heart of stone  
For a warmer place to sleep

Across a crowded room,

May dream all alone.

Beautiful South,Get Here,/b/beautiful+south/get+here_10026936.html,"Head over heels is fine  
Unless you're in stilettos  
Love knows no boundaries  
Unless your in one of love's ghettos  
  
Love climb every mountain high  
But some of us are stuck in a cell  
All you need is love, love, love  
And a bloody good tunnel as well  
  
You could get here by aeroplane or boat  
Not unreasonable demands  
But I could save myself the price of a ticket  
If I didn't let go of your hands  
  
Never mind killing me getting there  
But somebody has to make plans  
First embrace shoots you into space  
And doesn't give a damn where it lands  
  
Why not take a chance on love?  
Even at hundred to one  
If we promise that we'll never let love die  
Within a week one of us'll be gone  
  
Love sure makes the world go round  
And takes you for a hell of a ride  
But I don't wanna waste time searching for love  
When it's already stood at my side  
  
Love will make you blind to the truth  
Romantic novels all tell  
So I'll spend a little time romancing by myself  
But that turned me blind as well  
  
You can get here by crossing sea or desert  
I can barely make Blackpool Sands  
Railroad, caravan, save it for the mad man  
Lets see if love just stands  
  
Never mind killing me getting there  
But somebody has to make plans  
First embrace shoots you into space  
And doesn't give a damn where it lands  
  
Why not take a chance on love?  
Even at a hundred to one  
If we promise that we'll never let love die  
Then within a week one of us'll be gone  
  
Does the length of journey your heart makes  
Really provide any proof?  
All it really proves is love never moves  
When it's right there under your roof  
  
My heart is in the right place  
Then what's the point in making that trip  
Stay right here with your hand on my heart  
See how often you cause it to skip  
  
See how often you cause it to skip  
See how often you cause it to skip

To open up your wings, turn your head to the sky,  
Take off like a bird, let your heart be free.  
I found deep feeling devotion  
The day that I found your love.  
I can see above the diamond-studded sky,  
Hear the sound of night life passing by,  
Scent the early morning with every breath of air,  
Taste the secret potion that we both share.  
I found deep feeling devotion  
The day I found your love.

So, baby, don't cry  
I want you to know that, baby  
I'll be back someday  
  
Cheer up,  
The skies above are bound to clear up  
I like to stick around, but baby,  
I'll be back someday.  
  
Don't be blue, I'll return with love untold  
When I do, I want you to have and hold  
  
I know that you'll be close to me  
Wherever I go,  
So, when I say goodbye, remember  
I'll be back someday.

Jimmy Buffett,I Will Play For Gumbo,/j/jimmy+buffett/i+will+play+for+gumbo_20071848.html,"I don't smoke, I don't shoot smack  
But I got a spicy monkey ridin' on my back.  
Don't eat beignets, too much sugar and dough,  
But I will play for gumbo  
Yes, I will play for gumbo  
  
It started at my Grandma's kitchen by the sea,  
She warned me when she told me ""son the first one's free""  
It hit me like a rock or some Taikwondo,  
Cause I will play for gumbo  
Oh yea, I will play for gumbo.  
Chorus  
A piece of French bread  
With which to wipe my bowl,  
Good for the body.  
Good for the soul.  
It's a little like religion  
And a lot like sex.  
You should never know  
When you're gonna get it next.  
At midnight in the quarter or noon in Thibadeaux  
I will play for gumbo  
Yes, I will play for gumbo.  
  
I'm not talkin' quesadillas or a dozen Krispy Kremes,  
Or a pound of caviar that's a rich man's dream.  
No banana split or fillet of pompano.  
No, I will play for gumbo,  
Yeah, I will play for gumbo  
Chorus  
Maybe it's the sausage or those pretty pink shrimp  
Or that popcorn rice that makes me blow up like a blimp.  
Maybe it's that voodoo from Marie Leveaux,  
But I will play for gumbo  
Yeah, I will play for gumbo  
  
The sauce boss does his cookin' on the stage,  
Stirrin' and a singing for his nightly wage.  
Sweating and frettin' from his head to his toe,  
Playin' and swayin' with the gumbo  
Prayin' and buffetin' with the gumbo

It's 1977 and we've seen too many ads  
1977 and we're gonna show them all  
That apathy's a drag  
  
My mind is like a plastic bag  
That corresponds to all those ads  
It sucks up all the rubbish  
That is fed in through by ear  
I eat Kleenex for breakfast  
And use soft hygienic Weetabix  
To dry my tears  
  
My mind is like a switchboard  
With crossed and tangled lines  
Contented with confusion  
That is plugged into my head  
I don't know what's going on  
It's the operator's job, not mine  
I said  
  
My dreams I daren't remember  
Or tell you what I've seen  
I've dreamt that I was Hitler  
The ruler of the sea  
The ruler of the universe  
The ruler of the supermarket  
And even fatalistic me

Black Sabbath,I Witness,/b/black+sabbath/i+witness_20019484.html,"Across the desert of the burning dark, a  
Darkness which illuminates you,  
There's a place you've always wanted to be,  
Whose pleasures always did escape you,  
It's always been so out of reach, nothing, so near  
Ever felt so far  
And now it's here within your grasp, a never  
Ending burning says it all.  
  
[Chorus]  
As you drive into the darkness, in front the future  
Behind you history  
Caught alone in the dark night, do you think  
That's the way it's supposed to be.  
You don't believe your eyes, cos all they see is  
Lies, oh yeah.  
  
You better run from the holy man, the eyes that  
Will are set uppon you,  
Listen not to verse and prayer, song that thrill  
And voices tempt you  
The inner flame has fear of death, never, has  
Light ever seemed so dark.  
Pilgrims of sabbocracy, hear the hounds of  
Heaven, as they bark  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I witness a time and a place that never dies, still  
Frozen in time,  
This darkness the only place that I can hide, i  
Witness, a dream.

I witness a time and a place that never dies, still  
Frozen in time,  
This darkness the only place that I can hide, i

And reached out my hand.

A million sweet memoriers. Pinballed through my brain.  
The want to hold him one more time. Ran through my veins.

Involved with my thought catalog, analogue, rap catalog  
Keep my distance, and fear resistance, hurt by persistence  
The twisted web of tangled lies  
Strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste  
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes  
Against the state of being  
Feeling the weight-less-ness pressed between the ceiling  
Reeling around room  
Riding a bubble of sound proof  
It's the frequency making you  
Sha-Shake with every boom  
Involuntary muscle contraction  
Ignoring and drinking musical gas field euphoria  
The sound pounds to make the dead flush  
To have you a head rush with red thoughts and said stuff

Every time we feel the Blood going in

Christmas Songs,Christmas In Hollis,/c/christmas+songs/christmas+in+hollis_20674245.html,"It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark  
When I see a man chilling with his dog in the park  
I approached very slowly with my heart full of fear  
Looked at his dog, oh my God, an illin' reindeer  
But then I was illin' because the man had a beard  
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared  
So I turned my head a second and the man had gone  
But he must have dropped his wallet smack down on the lawn  
  
I picket the wallet up then I took a pause  
Took out the license and it cold said ""Santa Claus""  
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's  
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease  
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right  
So I was going home to mail it back to him that night  
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree  
Was a letter from Santa and the dough's for me  
  
It's Christmas time in Hollis Queens  
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens  
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese  
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees  
Decorate the house with lights at night  
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright  
In the fireplace is the yule log  
Beneath the mistle toe as we drink egg nog  
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's  
But each and every year we bust Chrsitmas carols  
  
Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it  
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit  
Jack Frost chillin, the orchids out  
And that's what Christmas is all about  
The time is now, the place is here  
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer  
  
My name's D. M. C. With the mic in my hand  
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman  
So open your eyes, lend us an ear  
We want to say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Lauryn Hill,Lost Ones,/l/lauryn+hill/lost+ones_20081611.html,"It's funny how money change a situation  
Miscommunication leads to complication  
My emancipation don't fit your equation  
I was on the humble, you on every station  
Some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb  
But remember not a game new under the sun  
Everything you did has already been done  
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston  
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run  
Now understand ""l-boogie's"" non-violent  
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun  
Can't take a threat to mi new born son  
L's been this way since creation  
A groupie call, you fall from temptation  
Now you want to ball over separation  
Tarnish my image in your conversation  
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
Now, now how come your talk turn cold?  
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul  
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control  
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold  
Wisdom is better than silver and gold  
I was hopeless, now I'm more hopeful  
Every man want to act like he's exempt  
Need to get down on his knees and repent  
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment  
Your movement's similar to a serpent  
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?  
Consequence is no coincidence  
Hypocrites always want to play innocent  
Always want to take it to the full out extent  
Always want to make it seem like good intent  
Never want to face it when it time for punishment  
I know you don't want to hear my opinion  
But there come many paths and you must choose one  
And if you don't change then the rain soon come  
See you might win some, but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some, but you really lost one  
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?  
When it's all done, did you really gain from  
What you done done? it's so silly how come?  
You just lost one  
  
Now don't you understand man universal law?  
What you throw out comes back to you, star  
Never underestimate those who you scar  
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!  
You can't hold god's people back that long  
The chain of shatan wasn't made that strong  
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond  
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong  
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song  
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone  
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn  
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn  
Now, some might listen and some might shun  
And some may think that they've reached perfection  
If you look closely you'll see what you've become  
Cause you might win some but you just lost one!  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some, but you really lost one  
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?  
When it's all done, did you really gain from  
What you done done, it's so silly how come?  
  
You might win some, but you really lost one  
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?  
When it's all done, did you really gain from  
What you done done, it's so silly how come?  
  
You just lost one  
What a bum-bum

Kris Kristofferson,Fallen Angel,/k/kris+kristofferson/fallen+angel_20080532.html,"It's sad to see we may never be the way we were before  
We don't believe in the magic of the music anymore  
And everything's older now and colder and grey  
Oh, darlin' I believe there's got to be a better way.  
  
It seems to me we've forgotten how to let our feelings show  
We seem to be so much farther from the dreams we used to know  
And too many more, my friend, are dying today  
Oh darlin' I believe there's got to be a better way.  
  
Listen to the fallen angels learning how to spread their wings.  
How will they make it all alone?  
Look into the children's laughter  
Tell me what tomorrow brings for those so far away from home.  
  
And I can say I'm not sorry for the things we tried to be  
But I'm afraid what we're heading toward is up, to you and me  
'Cause we got a choice, the future is ours you see  
We got a chance to change today  
  
Oh, darlin' don't you believe there's got to be a better way  
'Cause we got a choice, the furture is ours you see  
We got a chance to change it today.  
Oh I believe together there can be a better way  
Oh if we believe together we can build a better way.

where I keep hidden inspiration you will find.  
  
And when my petty anger goes to my head  
  
you'll find I'm better off dead.  
  
Oh and I don't hold the key  
  
to find out what is killing me its  
  
been so long but somehow i just still care  
  
I am a Romeo am a Romeo with no place to go  
  
  
Sometimes I think you hate me hang up the phone  
  
but take a closer look this hate I feel is my own.  
  
So many times I've loved you, more than myself,  
  
it's time to take that love and put it on the shelf.  
  
Oh, and when I hold you tight,  
  
it makes me want to scream and fight.  
  
Love turned to hate,  
  
some how it's just, how it's just,  
  
how it's just to late.  
  
  
I am a Romeo, am a Romeo with no place to go  
  
  
Rock the reggae music, 'cause it sounds so fine, right!  
  
When I hold you tight, in my arms you are mine,  
  
but in the morning when I wake up and I still feel the same,  
  
I know something goin on and I know who's to blame.  
  
Everytime I tell you I'm the real Romeo,  
  
it fills my soul and heart with anger, pain, and sorrow.  
  
'cause' somthings going on and I think you should know,  
  
so listen to my rhyme, 'cause this is how it goes:  
  
  
In a tight mini short in a short mini skirt,  
  
it feels so wrong and it feels so right.  
  
the more I think about it you're a pain in the ass,  
  
I told you many times, this time it's gonna last.  
  
Want the kind of woman who can make me feel right,  
  
not sloppy drunk sex on a Saturday night. 'cause,  
  
  
I am a Romeo, am a Romeo with no place to go  
  
  
Pull up your honey if you gotta one see,  
  
because your down with the style, 'cause your down with me. oh,  
  
rig the selector when your on the mixer,  
  
along with Peter Mitchell upon the echo chamber. Two, one,  
  
no they must see but no, they can't test me.  
  
Two, three of them come and say you can't test me.  
  
Because me rock the reggae music in a different stylee.  
  
Me rock the kinda reggae music right on time, because your down with the  
  
band that they call Sublime, right?  
  
  
Don't take it too slow, don't take me wrong,  
  
me know which way to go, me, me, me, me alright,  
  
me rock the reggae music day and all night.  
  
  
Makes you want to explode,  
  
makes me want to explode,  
  
makes me want to explode,  
  
makes you want to explode,  
  
sometimes it makes you want to explode.

Xavier Rudd,A 4Th World,/x/xavier+rudd/a+4th+world_20150689.html,"Here we are under these particular stars  
Here we stand Victorian  
Where the white folk can grow to know so  
Very little about the black folk  
The same folk who rightfully own  
This piece of beauty that we call our home  
Well negativity is often heard from society  
With conviction they preach  
Not even knowing of whom they speak  
I guess it's each to their own  
Those that want to will know  
I guess it's each to their own  
Because from the top the views are old and grey  
Well I feel so ashamed  
Of this system and these ways  
The tiny hearts that lead our nation  
And tiny minds that let them in  
And I see your confusion  
I see your pain  
I see your pain and your confusion  
And there's still some with my skin  
Who still try and hide the reason

Passing time with a runaway moon

Twice a thousand miles

I need the love I left behind  
  
Hold back the dawn awhile  
This will all work out  
Don't let this dream die  
There's a fire in the sky  
It's like the light in your eyes  
Thinkin' of you  
And I won't give up till your in my arms  
Never give up till what's lost is found  
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love again  
  
Now the night is dark with diamonds  
And I'm standing inside the rain  
Giving up your love  
Was the worst mistake I made  
There's a sound I hear in the distance  
Seems it's calling out my name  
Well I'll pay most any price  
I just hope I'm not too late  
  
Turn back the clock awhile  
Things will all work out  
That's what the dream is all about  
There's a fire in the sky  
It's like the light in your eyes  
Oh, it's true  
That I won't give up till your in my arms  
Never give up till what's lost is found  
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love  
  
Turn back the clock awhile

My sister's on the dope and my brother always picks his nose  
And Daddy's only happy when he's wearing Mama's pantyhose, yeah  
I just lost my job to a God damn robot (Good times!)  
Then my dog got in the freeze box, he ate everything I got  
But I've got my mule  
He's a very, very nice mule  
He walks with me home from school  
Cause he's a very, very nice mule  
When he was a baby my mother fed him gruel  
But now he prefers to dine on his own stool  
He always philosophizes with the rabbis after shul  
Cause he's a very, very pious mule  
When he sees a picture of a carrot he has a tendency to druel  
On Halloween he tries to scare me by dressing up as a ghoul  
He once challenged someone who stole my hat to a duel  
Cause he's a very, very Old school mule  
A needle-nosed plier is his favorite tool  
He lifeguards on a volunteer basis and the Rec. Center pool  
When I break down on the side of the road he shows up with unleaded fuel  
He's a devoted fan of Ms. Paula Abdul  
And also approves of the recent makeover of former folkie Jewel  
(coughing)  
When I told him Halle Berry's husband cheated he just shook his head and said
to himself 'what a fool'  
Cause he's a very, very monogamous mule

After several well-publicized arrests for public urination he now drinks
exclusively O'Doul  
And every year he puts on a presentation at the Boys Club to show kids smoking
isn't cool  
His favorite Elvis song is 'Don't be Cruel', no it's 'Hound Dog'

Imagine the glamor that comes out the flow  
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa  
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing  
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)

Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue  
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof  
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof

And that pretty much leave Malice at the table

She's all in her tender years.  
She fell in love with a sailor boy,  
It's true she loved him well.  
For to go off to sea with him  
Like she did not know how,  
She longed to see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
So she bargained with the sailor boy,  
All for a piece of gold.  
Straightaway then he led her  
Down into the hold,  
Sayin', ""I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes,  
Your jacket shall be blue.  
You'll see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the other sailors heard the news,  
Well, they fell into a rage,  
And with all the ship's company  
They were willing to engage.  
Saying, ""We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys,  
Overboard we'll throw her.  
She'll never see that seaport town  
Called Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the captain he heard the news,  
Well, he too fell in a rage,  
And with the whole ship's company  
He was willing to engage,  
Sayin', ""She'll stay in sailor's clothes,  
Her color shall be blue,  
She'll see that seaport town  
Call Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when they come down to Canada  
Scarcely 'bout half a year,  
She's married this bold captain  
Who called her his dear.  
She's dressed in silks and satins now,  
She cuts a gallant show,  
Finest of the ladies  
Down Canadee-i-o.  
  
Come, all you fair and tender girls,  
Wheresoever you may be,  
I'd have you to follow your own true love  
Whene'er he goes to sea.  
For if the sailors prove false to you,  
Well, the captain, he might prove true.  
You'll see the honor I have gained  
By the wearing of the blue.

Nasaktan nang minsan  
Pilit kong iiwasan  
Ang iyong ngiti  
Chorus:  
Ayoko na sanang magmahal  
Ayoko na sanang umibig pa  
Ayoko na sanang masaktan  
Ang puso kong laging nagdurusa  
Ayoko na sanang mabigo  
At paglaruan ang aking puso  
Ayoko na sana  
Ayoko na sana  
Maraming pangarap na di nabuo  
Maraming pangako naglaho  
Di lang miminsan na nabigo  
Sa pagsubok ng mundo  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Ngunit nang ika'y lumayo  
Mundo ko'y biglang huminto  
Sana'y magbalik ka sa akin sinta

Z-Ro,World Wide,/z/z+ro/world+wide_20347115.html,"(Z-Ro talking)  
Uh, seem like they got my life on the big screen  
Z-Ro versus the world, feel me round one  
[Z-Ro]  
Is it reality or just a fable  
The most powerful lyricists in the world was on a low budget label  
Even if I don't clear me in I just want to be living well  
Not saying that heaven is promised to me but I don't want to believe in hell  
Feeling on coming also cause problems worry me  
If it ain't the stress somebody's always trying to bury me  
So thinking I'm undercovers and the dope they try to deal me  
Jealousy and envy make my niggas want to kill me  
Everybody want to pick up a gun and bust thinking artillery fin to be  
drilling me nigga  
But I' sick of this pistol play bumping ain't no more killng me nigga  
Cause I'm a soldier, trying to keep his mind at ease  
And if I squeeze then we all bleed  
[Chorus - 2x]  
Feel a nigga worldwide, not just in Texas  
I think I'm bout to lose my mind, aggravated and restless  
I don't want to die  
[Z-Ro]  
Look at how they made me, traditon systems raised me  
The drama that they give me never ceases to amaze me  
They tell me that my mind's gone, coming up is what my mind's on  
I guess there's nothing left to do but get my grind on  
Thinking about my family but knowing they neglect me  
I'm not gonna give up, I'm gonna make my family respect me  
I'm talking to my father now, daddy I'm a grown up  
Depending on you is false-a-fied because you haven't shown up  
Caught up in these streets I'm taking penitentiary chances  
I done forgived and I done forget plus I'm not giving you anymore chances  
Quick to run out of the house for nothing now your son is feeling anger  
Remember the times you couldn't come around because your life has been in
danger  
I'm a leader to follow is not my destiny  
But I guess it was written for me to fall victim to jealousy  
It's killing me to stay alive, but there ain't no use in me crying  
No matter what I guess it's what is right, on southside  
[Chorus - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
Whoever would of thought that I would be this fam-ous  
Put in work until it hurt but keep pretending it's pain it's  
Affiliated with killers when we fight us to the death  
Picture your partner cocked and aim and headed straight for your chest  
It's hard to focus cause my homies keep on killing eachother  
Everybody stressing cause ain't nobody feeling eachother  
I often conversate with god but who's to say if he's listening  
Even though I died as a sinner but resurrected as a christian  
At 11 years old I was told that most friends turn to foes  
From velicos to calicoes it helps when our battle folds  
If it ain't true, if it ain't crew, it's a mexican deed  
I'ma catch an attitude instntly bitch you plexing with me  
And ain't no begging for mercy because you shot my nigga  
And I swear to god everywhere you go it's gone be hot my nigga  
And maybe god can forgive you but see the streets seeing different  
They want you dead you might not make it to prison, bitch  
[Chorus - 4x]  
(Z-Ro talking)  
Ha ha, new millennium music, shouts out  
Dirty D, Anonymous, Heavy Rotation  
My nigga Pop Belly I love you boy

That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
And now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding  
The future that lies before me I cannot see  
(look at, look at, the future I cannot see)  
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising  
Lighting up the world for everyone, but not for me  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame

Backstreet Boys,Shout,/b/backstreet+boys/shout_20595461.html,"Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces,  
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons,  
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is,  
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things,  
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it,  
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it  
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it,  
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me.  
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be,  
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty,  
There has to be some type of change for this day and age,  
We gotta rearrange and flip the page,  
Living encaged like animals and cannibals,  
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five,  
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive  
Peace of mind's so hard to find.  
  
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout  
You know it makes me wanna shout,  
Throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now  
  
Problems, complications and accusations  
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces  
A war is taking place.  
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace  
Is increasing the height of your spirituality.  
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions  
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living.  
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning,  
But will we live to see the dawn.  
  
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be  
Is a living hell torturing our minds.  
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light,  
And the love in our hearts will shine.  
  
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other  
Whatever happened to protecting each other  
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure,  
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever.  
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted,  
Family values are contradicted.  
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough.  
  
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout  
You know it makes me wanna shout,  
Throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about

Wondering why the laughing and the crying  
The making fun, and never lying

To thank you for those limes you saved me

To the same old house alone  
And in the silence of these empty rooms  
I take shelter from the storm  
But I brought a paint box  
And some brushes to pass the time  
Since you've been gone  
It's a portrait of a broken man  
And the colors always run  
  
A figure in a landscape  
It's a work of art, you'll see  
A figure in a landscape  
It's a masterpiece of loneliness, that's me  
  
Well I climb the stairs in this haunted house  
To find your spirit everywhere  
With the bright stars on the rooftops  
And my old friend the moon is there  
But I can't quite get the colors right  
See I'm reaching for the deepest blue  
It's a one man show, I'm free again  
But still belong to you

With your ghost and memories  
Got what I wanted I got my freedom  
But I miss you still

I left it off the hook  
Just to hear it ring  
You told me you were better off alone  
I never knew that tears could stain  
  
I'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars  
Lookin' down at all the cars  
I can see you  
In the window of your favorite corner bar  
But to reach you is just too far  
And I might as well be on mars  
  
The city seems so old and grey and beat  
It closes in and makes me want to suffocate  
And you just live across the street  
But that's a billion miles away  
  
You've turned my world into a dark and lonely place  
Like a planet lost in space, my light is fadin'  
I'd cross the universe to be right where you are  
But I'm right in your backyard  
And I might as well be on mars  
  
Chorus  
I might as well be on mars  
You can't see me  
I might as well be the man on the moon  
You can't hear me  
Oh, can you feel me so close  
And yet so far  
Baby, I might as well be on mars  
  
Baby, I can't fly  
If I could I'd come down to ya  
Maybe I should try  
  
I'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars  
Lookin' down at all lthe cars  
I can see you  
In the window of your favorite corner bar  
But to reach is just too far  
And I might as well be on mars

Can't they see I'm dead  
There ain't nothin' left to do this mornin'  
'Cept to make it to my bed  
I was out till all hours  
Raisin' Cain once again  
I don't care about the hours  
Only how much did I spend  
'Cause I got a hangover  
I won't make it through the day  
I got a hangover  
So just leave me where I lay  
I started slow after sundown  
I tiptoed right up till ten  
Then after while I went downtown  
It was the beginning of my end  
Now I got a hangover  
I won't make it through the day  
I got a hangover  
So just leave me where I lay  
Oh, how am I gonna stake my claim on the future  
When I cannot lift my head  
Oh, I ain't nothin' but a drunken loser  
And my liver's overfed  
'Cause I got a hangover  
I won't make it through the day  
'Cause I got a hangover  
So just leave me where I lay  
Now I got a hangover  
I won't make it through the day  
'Cause I got a hangover  
So just leave me where I lay

Hank Williams,THE FUNERAL,/h/hank+williams/the+funeral_20064186.html,"I was walking in Savannah past a church, decayed and dim  
When slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn  
My sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew  
'Til I found myself environed in a little colored pew  
Out front a colored couple sat in sorrow nearly wild  
On the altar was a casket and in the casket was a child  
I could picture him while living, curly hair protruding lips  
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my hurried southern trips  
Then rose a sad, old colored preacher from his little wooden desk  
With a manner sort of awkward and countenance grotesque  
The simplicity and shrewdness in his Ethiopian face  
Showed the wisdom and the ignorance of a crushed, undying race  
And he said, ""Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay  
For the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away  
He was doing very finely and he 'ppreciates your love  
But his sho nough father wanted him in the big house up above  
The Lord didn't give you that baby, by no hundred thousand miles  
He just think you need some sunshine and he lent it for a while  
And he let you keep and love him 'til your hearts were bigger grown  
And these silver tears you're shedding now, are just interest on the loan  
Just think my poor dear mourners creeping long on sorrow?s way  
What a blessed picnic this here baby got today  
Your good fathers and good mothers crowd the little fella round  
In the angels 'tender garden of the big plantation ground  
And his eyes they brightly sparkle at the pretty things he view  
But a tear came and he whispered, ""I want my parents too""  
Then the angel's chief musicians teach that little boy a song  
Says if only they be faithful, they'll soon be comin' 'long  
And so my poor dear mourners, let your hearts with Jesus rest  
And don't go to criticizn' the one what knows the best  
He has give us many comforts He's got the right to take away  
To the Lord be praised in glory, now and ever, let us pray

Still believe the sun will shine on me  
  
I still believe there's a reason, there's a meaning to why we're here  
There is a place where we can go to where we don't have to live in fear  
They're trying to tell me that the moon is in the ocean.  
And I'm just dreaming my life away  
  
I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
I still believe true love is the answer, don't turn away  
'cause I believe in love, that's the only way  
  
I believe in every moment, every heartbeat that we're here  
And we're a part of each other and forever it seems so clear  
I don't believe that I'm just walking in the darkness  
Or that I'm lost without a prayer  
  
I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
  
Oh now love is the answer and oh it's right here  
And I know we've got to remember it's only together for now and forever  
  
I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
I still believe true love is the answer  
Don't turn away, 'cause I believe in love  
'cause I believe in love, 'cause I believe in love and that's the only way.

in drifting clouds, in passing crowds, there's you

your laughter sings, the memory clings a new  
  
My darling, you're so very much a part of me  
I close my eyes and feel you in the heart of me, honestly  
There is no night can hide you from my sight  
in dreams, you see, I'll always be, with you!

Me chat by meself me no combinate  
Me study very hard because me want graduate  
Up de MC ladder I man Essulate  
To be a boss MC I'm a chief candidate  
  
True me fascinate nor irritate and me originate  
Round de classic Micro-centre dat is where me locate  
Me no select no tune an Jerry don't operate  
Fe see me lift speaker - box you must fortunate  
Cause asdedance down me gone home me gone go hibernate  
Going home de other night me can't remember de date  
De early hours of de morning before people a wake  
  
Bopsing down de road it was me worst mistake  
Police come draw down pon me an a investigate  
Him say ""Hey son where you coming from don't you know that it's late  
I've heard about you niggers and the trouble you create""  
I said ""I'm coming from a party and me going home straight  
Me just stop a de shop to buy some cigarette an chocolate""  
When me explain de situation him stop interrogate  
Turn around jump in a I'm panda car an say ""See you mate""  
  
Is a good ting me never cheeky or be obstinate  
Or me could a end up visiting de damn magistrate  
De house way me live in you know it must decorate  
  
An de girl way me love ave to affectionate  
Nem ya Linda lyrics you must penetrate  
So listen every word I man and quotate  
True me talking very clear you no need fe translate  
Cause when me riding pon de riddim me no mek no mistake  
  
Gast contagious disease I man vaccinate  
An true me no wan catch a dose me no fornicate

Some time me chat it slow sometime me accelerate  
Dem ya kinds style you must appreciate  
  
'nough gal come to me a congratulate  
Dem say ""Jerry your so good looking can I have you portrait""  
I say ""Yes of course my darling but you know you have to wait""  
  
Well dais a something I man have to state  
A trollop is a woman with a whole heap a weight  
Don't tell her to her face cause she will aggravate  
And if she sit down pon you you will suffocate  
  
At de mile is 'nough excitement I Jerry create  
And you know that its not hard for me to exterminate  
Any boy way come a dance an a duplicate  
A style him get off a Saxon or a old yard tape  
  
I say de lyrics way me chat dem must variate  
An 'nough people dem a say don't me impertinent  
Any gal way me like we must be intimate  
But me only make love when me in private

Cuts like daggers to my heart

Baby don't you fear

Play the simple game  
With all your broken rules  
I'm calling out your name  
But my heart just still refuses  
  
Don't you be afraid

Stop running from love

There's a bar and they call for me and you

Nowhere to Run to even if we could  
Too late to save us but try to understand

Nothing to die for

I wanna give it all, give it all to you  
  
I wanna dream what you dream  
Go where you're going  
I only have one life  
And I only wanna live it with you  
I wanna sleep where you sleep  
Connect with your soul  
The only thing I want in life  
I only wanna live it with you  
Oh yeah  
oh yeah  
I only wanna live it with you  
Only wanna live it with you  
  
If I came to your crib would you open the door?  
I don't wanna go down that road no more  
Said you wanted it bad, but girl I wanted it more  
You're the only one I wanna be with, yay  
Yay, yeah  
  
I wanna dream what you dream  
Go where you're going  
I only have one life  
And I only wanna live it with you  
I wanna sleep where you sleep  
Connect with your soul  
The only thing I want in life  
I only wanna live it with you

And never, never, never, never  
Let it be said that it's true  
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone  
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone  
  
They're the kind of people that'll always let you down  
I know you, too, you don't ever give it a frown  
Leave me, leave me, leave me...  
  
Don't you know some people  
They just don't know when to stop  
They can't tell the floor from the ceiling or the top  
And there're other types, they always make you wait  
And they're always the first to say  
The state you come from  
  
Leave me, leave me, leave me...  
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me forever  
Love me, love me, love me...  
  
Leave me, leave me, leave me...

The Jam,Fly,/j/jam/fly_20068826.html,"The way that sunlight flits across your skirt,  
Makes me feel I'm from another world,  
To touch your face in the morning light.  
I hope you're always gonna be around.  
The times I struggle to understand why,  
The ancient proverbs like who am I?  
Why am I here and what have I done?  
I see the answers place my trust in you  
  
Trust in you love, be with me then,  
That's when I want you, that's when I need you the most.  
  
I want us to be like peter pan  
But dreams it seems are weightless as sand,  
And mans supposedly is made of sand  
It seems that man cannot survive at all  
  
Lets disappear love, lets fly away  
Into the demi-monde, into the twilight zone  
The times inside I spent screaming at you  
Release me please from this mortal jail  
One shrug or smile can determine my fate,  
I'm lost for days and have myself to blame  
  
Something I'm giving, is yours for the taking,  
Something like sunlight, love is a spotlight  
Love is all sorrow, still Ill meet you tomorrow  
And look forward to see you, now I can't live without you

Uncle Tupelo,Before I Break,/u/uncle+tupelo/before+i+break_20153031.html,"On liquor I spend my last dime  
  
Sunday morning, 8am  
Cursing myself again  
Drinking like this one might be my last  
  
Memories of making jokes  
Too much beer and talk-show hosts  
One of them that's fading fast  
  
Here's to waking up at night  
Drunk and undressed by the side of the road  
You're still thinking  
  
That you can't go on like this  
Before I break down  
You keep saying thanks so much, I can't live  
Thanks so much, I've had enough  
  
Well, it'd do me just fine to make it through the night  
On liquor I spend my last dime  
  
A worried man drinks a healthy drink  
But he drinks nine or ten until he's done  
Then he'll tell you his life story  
But he won't stop until he's told you and everyone  
  
Here's to waking up at night  
Drunk and undressed by the side of the road  
You're still thinking  
  
That you can't go on like this

The world still turns like you said it would  
But this pain seems to never let me go  
And there is really no movin' on  
There's only going along  
  
And I will always be  
Better for you loving me  
Better for the times we shared  
That travel with me everywhere  
  
And I will always try  
To hold my head up to the sky  
If only just to let you know  
That straight from my heart  
I still miss you so  
  
If I could I would gladly trade  
A thousand tomorrows for one yesterday  
There are so many things that I would say  
You're a part of every memory  
That lives on in me

Weaving figure eights and circles around your head

Forgot what I was looking for  
Try to guide me in the right direction  
Making use of all this time  
Keeping everything inside  
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

I'm letting you down  
I'm dancing till dawn  
I'm fooling around  
I'm not giving up  
I'm making your love  
This city's made us crazy and we must get out  
  
""This is not goodbye,"" she said,  
""It's just time for me to rest my head.""  
She does not walk, she runs instead  
Down these jagged streets and into my bed

Forgot what I was looking for  
Try to guide me in the right direction  
Making use of all this time  
Keeping everything inside  
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

After all of the things you've put me through

There stands the priest of sinners, consolation in his hands  
Though he prays he won't need it, he keeps it by his side  
Waiting for the face up and the answer in her eyes  
All while the music's playing a backdrop serenade  
There's only one point of view  
To be doing the things, things that lovers should do  
  
Disco-queens in dancestep, moving face to face  
All tangled up in neon don't think it's some disgrace  
The blue western denim, the east coats razor edge  
The European fashion, the leathers and re-threads  
All while the music's playing a backdrop serenade

To be doing the things, things that lovers should do

And sometimes you just can't  
'Cause your lips  
Feel like they're glued together  
And no one gives a damn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the world on a string  
There's no songs left to sing  
Just sing  
Sing  
  
I see the good  
I see the bad  
The revolution  
I see the happy  
I see the sad  
The absolution  
I see hate  
And I see love  
When the world's on a string  
  
I see the good  
I see the bad  
The revolution  
I see the happy  
I see the sad  
The absolution  
I see hate  
And I see love  
When the world's on a string  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I'm down on my knees  
And it hurts to believe (I'm bleeding)  
You'll bring me back to life  
When there's no songs to sing  
And no flowers to bring (No feeling)  
And you'll bring me back to life  
And you'll bring me back to life  
And you'll bring me back to life.

If you know what's good for you  
Stay out of his way  
If you have no insurance  
Stay out of his sight

I can tell he's looking for a fight  
Look at his face  
I can tell he's looking for a fight  
Look at his nose, he kills for fun  
He's one of those people we were warned about  
So many years ago  
His days gonna come  
Every dog has his day

Sinners shall never go to heaven [Repeat: x4]  
  
If you're on the right side of the law, don't be where he is  
He is wanted dead or alive  
He kills for fun, stay out of his way  
I can tell he's looking for a fight  
Look at his face

Ozzy Osbourne,Here For You,/o/ozzy+osbourne/here+for+you_20421613.html,"I remember all the good times  
Sometimes I'd wonder would it last  
I used to dream about the future  
But now the future is the past  
I don't wanna live in yesterday  
Cross my heart until I die  
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring  
Because today has just begun  
No matter whatever else I've done  
I'm here for you  
I'm here for you  
  
So now I sit here and I wonder  
Whatever happened to my friends  
Too many bought a one way ticket  
But I'll be with you till the end  
  
I don't wanna live in yesterday  
Cross my heart until I die  
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring  
Because today has just begun  
No matter whatever else I've done  
I'm here for you  
  
You're my religion, you're my reason to live  
You are the heaven in my hell  
We've been together for a long, long time  
And I just can't live without you  
No matter what you do  
I'm here for you  
  
I don't wanna live in yesterday  
Cross my heart until I die  
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring  
Because today has just begun  
No matter whatever else I've done  
I'm here for you  
I'm here for you  
I'm here for you

Ella Fitzgerald,As Long As I Live,/e/ella+fitzgerald/as+long+as+i+live_20045676.html,"Maybe I can't live to love you as long as I want to.  
Life isn't long enough baby, but I can love you as long as I live.  
  
Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,  
But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live.  
  
I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.  
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains and eat an apple every day then see  
the doctor anyway.  
  
What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.  
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.  
  
I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow  
I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,  
And that would never never do  
  
What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.  
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.

U2,Like A Song,/u/u2/like+a+song_20141617.html,"Like a song I have to sing  
I sing it for you.  
Like the words I have to bring  
I bring it for you.  
  
And in leather, lace and chains we stake our claim.  
Revolution once again  
No I won't, I won't wear it on my sleeve.  
I can see through this expression and you know I don't believe.  
Too old to be told, exactly who are you?  
Tonight, tomorrow's too late.  
  
And we love to wear a badge, a uniform  
And we love to fly a flag  
But I won't let others live in hell  
As we divide against each other  
And we fight amongst ourselves  
Too set in our ways to try to rearrange  
Too right to be wrong, in this rebel song  
Let the bells ring out  
Let the bells ring out  
Is there nothing left?  
Is there, is there nothing?  
Is there nothing left?  
Is honesty what you want?  
  
A generation without name, ripped and torn  
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain  
Nothing at all  
And if you can't help yourself  
Well take a look around you  
When others need your time  
You say it's time to go... it's your time.  
Angry words won't stop the fight  
Two wrongs won't make it right.  
A new heart is what I need.  
Oh, God make it bleed.  
Is there nothing left?

And I watched her put her satin things away

We're picking up the pieces, and putting away the past  
We've got a lot of broken dreams to mend

Passed a dog in an unmarked grave  
The old girl hobbles, nylons sagging  
Talks to her sisters in the ground  
I saw a lie in the mirror this morning  
I heard a prophesy all around  
  
And Emily they come and go  
The shadows and the distant sounds  
But Emily don't be afraid  
When the weight of angels weighs you down  
  
Emily prays to a faded hero  
In a little frame clutched to her gown  
Hears the voice of promise in his memory  
Tonight's the night they let the ladder down  
In a cage sits a gold canary  
By a wicker chair and a rosewood loom  
As a soul ascends aboard the evening  
Canary sings to an empty room  
  
And Emily they come and go  
The shadows and the distant sounds  
But Emily don't be afraid  
When the weight of angels weighs you down

What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk.  
Let's take a stroll through the park, down a lane where it's dark  
And a heart that's controlled, may relax on an old fashioned walk.  
I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart,  
There's nothing like walking and having a ""heart to heart.""  
I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind.  
She was wrapped up and sold, coming home from an old fashioned walk.

The best you'll be is nearly dead or failed

Full tank, pockets lined with cash  
Full throttle, gonna rip some ass.  
Drive all day and through the night,  
Romance the road, winding left to right.  
The stars above guide me, the moonlight is free.  
A feeling inside me and the whole world to see.  
Driving fast makes me feel good,  
The speed of light trapped under my hood.  
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do.  
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502.  
Hundreds of miles rolled off today.  
Signs lose their meanings, minutes tick away.  
Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all.  
Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol.  
Drive until daybreak, always on the go.  
Life on the freeway, night shift 'til dawn patrol.  
Driving fast makes me feel good,  
The speed of light trapped under my hood.  
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do.  
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502.  
Stopped for a 502, next time it's gonna be you.  
Stars above guide me  
This feeling inside me  
I drive until daybreak.  
Life on the freeway is Hell.  
I'm coming through

I knew he was just my style  
My only regret is we've never met  
Though I dream of him all the while  
  
But he doesn't know I exist  
No matter how I may persist  
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me  
Though I live at fifty-one-thirty-five Kensington Avenue  
And he lives at fifty-one-thirty-three  
  
How can I ignore the boy next door  
I love him more than I can say  
Doesn't try to please me  
Doesn't even tease me  
And he never sees me glance his way  
  
And though I'm heart-sore, the boy next door  
Affection for me won't display  
I just adore him  
So I can't ignore him  
The boy next door  
  
I just adore him  
So I can't ignore him

Drifting endlessly by the bridge

Do not suffer through the game of chance that plays  
Always doors to lock away your dreams  
Think it over  
Time will heal your fear  
Think it over  
Balance the thoughts that release within you  
  
Childlike soul dreamer one journey  
One to seek and see in every light do open  
True pathways away  
  
Carrying closer go gently  
Holding doors will open every way  
You wander true pathways away

After all don't doubt your part  
Be ready to be loved

It's enough to make a grown man sit and cry  
It's enough to make you wonder  
It's enough to make the world roll up and die  
  
I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be  
The way the people work with their machines  
Serenity's a long time coming to me  
In fact I don't believe I know what it means  
  
In the east a shaded moon is hanging lazily  
I do believe I saw the old man smile  
I do believe I did  
I do believe he's been laughing all the while  
  
I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be  
The way the people work with their machines

Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it

I buckle knees like leg braces, cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you

So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on  
From now to infinite, let icon be bygones

I tried threats, but moved on to a promise

Me and my -ah- mother and father - and a  
Grandmother and a grandfather - were driving through  
The desert, at dawn, and a truck load of Indian  
Workers had either hit another car, or just - I don't  
Know what happened - but there were Indians scattered  
All over the highway, bleeding to death.  
  
So the car pulls up and stops. That was the first time I tasted fear.  
I musta' been about four - like a child is like a flower,  
His head is just floating in the breeze, man.  
The reaction I get now thinking about it, looking back  
Is that the souls of the ghosts of those dead Indians  
Maybe one or two of 'em, were just running around freaking out,  
And just leaped into my soul.  
And they're still in there.  
  
Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding  
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.

Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice

Bloody red sun of fantastic L.A.

Blood will be born in the birth if a nation  
Blood is the rose of mysterious union  
Blood on the rise, it's following me.

Indian says, nothing at all.

I'm a child of this age  
Locked into the pages of your book  
And when I am but dust and clay  
And all the children stop to take a look

And the heights I did aspire  
Or will they tear out the pages of the book  
To light a fire

And if it's someone else  
I'd rather be just by myself

Right now it seems so hard to tell  
Don't wanna worry  
But is our love alive  
I'm in a hurry  
My feelings I can't hide  
Say do you say, won't you say you love me  
Say do you say, that you need me still  
Say won't you say that we'll stay together  
Say we always will  
Faithfully yours my love is real, babe  
If that is what you want then I'll be there  
'Cause I feel so sure this is the real thing  
My heart with you will stay, yeah  
Say do you say  
Say do you say  
Say won't you say that we'll stay together  
Say we always will  
And when I miss you  
I try to keep my head  
'Cause when I kiss you  
My heart speaks out instead

Say do you say, that you need me still

Mouths full of chocolate-covered cream  
Arms that can only lift a spoon

Made my money by cutting grass,  
Got fired by fried chicken ass,  
All in a small town, Napanee.

Where do I belong forever,  
In whose arms, the time and place?

Would someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World  
  
I never spend less than an hour,  
Washin' my hair in the shower,  
It always takes 5 hours to make it straight,  
So I'll braid it in a zillion braids,  
Though it may take all friggen day,  
There's nothin' else better to do anyway.

Lay under the milky way,  
On and on it's getting too late out,

Sneak out of the house.

Ancient eyes are peeping, from his infant head.

Drawing up their Bargains, trading baby lives.

Above her head a portrait of her father  
The wilted favor that he gave her still fastened to the frame  
""They've got his bones and everything he owns  
I've got his name""  
  
Well you can laugh at this sentimental story  
But in time you'll have to make amends  
The sudden chill where lovers doubt their immortality  
As the clouds cover the sky the evening ends  
Describing a picture of eyes finally closing  
As you sometimes glimpse terrible faces in the fire  
We'll I'm the lucky goon  
Who composed this tune  
From birds arranged on the high wire  
  
Who on earth is tapping at the window?  
Does that face still linger at the pane?  
I saw you shiver though the room was like a furnace  
A shadow of regret across a young mother's face  
So toll the bell or rock the cradle  
Please don't let me fear anything I cannot explain  
I can't believe, I'll never believe in anything again

Day after day I rock the speed  
Night after night  
Night after night  
  
Love on the run  
Always loaded like a gun  
For love  
  
Turn outside in  
And inside out  
With me you'll find the kicks you've never found  
I kiss the pearl  
Right from the shell  
Until You'll feel what all these words can't tell  
Day after day  
Day after day I'm burning free  
Night after night  
Night after night  
  
Love on the run  
Always loaded like a gun  
For love on the run

But I've been there and if I can survive  
I can keep you alive

Same old faces, but a different town  
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide

You know it won't feel so cold.  
  
It's 5 am, and I just got into bed  
And the heart of the city is almost gone,  
And I know what is right  
And I know what is wrong

In a cold moonlight.

I can't wait another minute, hour day or night,  
I can't wait until the morning,  
You know it feels so cold.  
  
Sometimes in between my dreams at night,  
I walk alone I'm going underground.  
And in the distance I can hear a crowd.  
It makes me wonder what it's all about.  
All about  
All about  
  
It's the same old consolation,  
Different faces in the same old town,  
Nowhere to run to  
Nowhere to hide,  
They're dancing with the shadows,  
In a cold moonlight  
  
And I can't wait until the morning

That's small consolation but i know just how you feel  
  
With your heart broke and running from the reason  
You got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me  
Heart broke , who kept me from leaving?  
With my heart broke  
  
Nobody said it was going to be easy  
We all have feelings that need a softer touch  
But nobody said that it would not be worth it

If there's a chance that you care  
Then, please, say you do, Baby  
Say it and make my craziest dream come true

Dolly Parton,Comes And Goes,/d/dolly+parton/comes+and+goes_20728309.html,"(Porter Wagoner)  
Now and then, here and there, I still see you  
And sometimes my memory lets me hear your voice, so soft and low  
But like the wind you travel in, you seem to come and go  
At times, my mind is crystal clear  
And then I think of you  
Then the spin of the room I'm in  
Brings you into view  
Love that once  
Held my mind completely in control  
Now makes it spin like tornado wind  
As it comes and goes  
Well, look who's here  
I told myself that you'd be coming soon  
I hope that you can stay for a little while  
It's so lonesome in this room  
And you look just the same today  
Do you still love me so?  
What's that you say, you can't stay?  
You seem to come and go  
At times my mind is crystal clear  
And then I think of you  
Then the spin of the room I'm in  
Brings you into view  
Love that once  
Held my mind completely in control  
Now makes it spin like tornado winds  
As it comes and goes

Covered with a new snow

Go outside and play

You'll wear your dad's old Stetson

Shining night and day

Go dream shopping in the mall  
The kids can do the Santa thing  
Photographs and all  
  
We'll get the biggest tree this year  
And trim it to the top  
And spend a whole lot more  
Than what we've got  
But so what  
  
Come next spring  
I know we will be  
Ready for the sunshine  
Right now throwin' snowballs  
At each other's such a fun time  
  
Kids will think we're crazy  
For awhile and that's okay

That bompy little couch that made into a bed  
Shower down the hall and footsteps through the wood

Times were hard for us for quite a while  
But through those hungry days she faced it with a smile  
Not wanting me to know she's carrying my child  
She tried to ease my mind  
And for my woman's love, for my woman's love  
Each day I thank the Lord above for my sweet woman's love  
Through the years of moving town to town  
Still searching for a dream somehow we never found  
And wondering if we would ever settle down  
Her love never died  
And if I have many things today  
I owe it to the love I had along the way  
No matter what went wrong, no matter come what may  
She stood by my side  
And for my woman's love, for my woman's love

What's that? Who's driving?  
Where we goin'? Who knows?  
I-We come to take you home  
  
How many people do you think I am  
Pretend I am somebody else  
You can pretend I'm and old millionaire  
A millionaire washing his hands  
Rattle the bones, dreams that stick out  
A medical chart on the wall  
Soft violence and hands touch your throat  
Ev'ryone wants to explode  
  
And when your hands get dirty  
Nobody knows you at all  
Don't have a window to slip out of  
Lights on, nobody home  
  
Click click- see ya later  
Beta beta- no time to rest  
Pika pika- risky business  
All that blood, will never cover that mess.  
  
Hi hi hi hi hi  
So soft hard feelings  
What's that, who's driving  
No tricks lets go  
I-We come to take you home  
I-We come to take you home  
Hi hi hi hi hi  
Etc.

Idina Menzel,A Hero Comes Home,/i/idina+menzel/a+hero+comes+home_20658562.html,"Out of the mist of history  
He'll come again  
Sailing on ships across the sea  
To a wounded Nation  
  
Signs of a saviour  
Like fire on the water  
It's what we prayed for  
One of our own  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home  
He goes where no one has gone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
Deep in the heart of darkness sparks  
A dream of light  
Surrounded by hopelessness  
He finds the will to fight  
  
There's no surrender  
Always remember  
It doesn't end here  
We're not alone  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home  
He goes where no one has gone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
And he will come back on the crimson tide  
Dead or alive  
And even though we know the bridge has burned  
He will return  
He will return  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home  
He knows of places unknown  
Always  
A hero comes home  
  
Someday they'll carve in stone  
""The hero comes home""  
  
He goes and comes back alone  
But always  
A hero comes home  
  
Just wait  
Though wide he may roam  
Always  
A hero comes home

Scorpions,A Moment In A Million Years,/s/scorpions/a+moment+in+a+million+years_20122569.html,"The lights are slowly fading down  
There's no one else, just you and me  
Nothing ever changed  
I see your faces in the crowd  
It seems I know each one of you  
For all my life  
I wish this night could last forever  
But it's time to go  
I saw you laugh, I saw you cry  
All for one and one for all  
Nothing ever changed  
The way you sang just blew my mind  
It gave me chills from head to toe  
What a glorious night  
To me it could have lasted forever  
But it's time to go  
A moment in a million years  
Is all I've got for you  
A moment in a million years  
To make some dreams come true  
A moment that I won't forget  
Until the day I die  
A moment in a million years  
Called life  
The bus is waiting right outside  
To hit the road and once again  
I leave you all behind  
I chase another dream tonight  
And by the time you'll be home  
I'll be far away  
Nothing seems to last forever  
It's time to go  
A moment in a million years  
Is all I've got for you  
A moment in a million years  
To make some dreams come true  
A moment that I won't forget  
Until the day I die  
A moment in a million years  
Called life

Of burgers on the grill  
When the relatives go home  
I'm stuck with chicken bones  
And burgers on the grill  
  
There's a steak tip on the coals  
It fell down through the holes  
And now it's caught on fire  
Smells like a funeral pyre  
I was tryin' to get it back  
But it's turnin' pretty black  
Steak tip on the coals  
  
Yeah!  
  
Wiener on the foil  
The skin begins to boil  
I dropped it in the soil  
I thought that it was spoiled  
So I washed it with a hose  
And fed it to Aunt Rose

These thoughts and the strain I am under

A million miles our vagabond heels  
Clocked up beneath the clouds  
They're counting down to show time  
When we do it for real with the crowds  
Air miles are owing  
But they don't come for free  
And they don't give you any for pain  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
The rimshots come down like cannon fire  
And thunder off the wall  
There's a man in every corner  
And each one is giving his all  
  
This is my fife  
This is my drum  
So you never will hear me complain  
  
And if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning  
  
Well if you're inclined  
To go up on the wall  
It can only be fast and high  
And those who don't like the danger  
Soon find something different to try  
When there's only a ringin' in your ears  
And an echo down memory lane  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
  
The show's packing up  
I sit and watch the convoy  
Leaving town  
There's no pretending I'm not a fool,  
For riding around and around  
Like the pictures you keep of your old wall of death  
You showed me one time on the plane  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
A million miles of vagabond sky  
Clocked up above the clouds  
I'm still your man for the roaming  
For as long as there's roamin' allowed  
  
There'll be a rider  
And there'll be a wall  
As long as the dreamer remains  
  
And if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning

I thought that I knew everything  
I could make it in this scene  
To be a rising star that only gleamed  
But all the answers disagreed  
With the questions held for me  
I was legal now at twenty-one  
  
I knew the way the world should run  
My God just look what I had done  
Simply drunk and having fun  
Looked for friends, but I found none  
All alone at twenty-one

I felt my body's doing time  
And In my back a hundred knives  
From friends at twenty-five  
  
And now as Gabriel sounds my warning bell  
I'd buy your life, if you would sell  
A year or two, if less compelled  
So live your life and live it well

And the darkness still has work to do  
The knotted chord's untying  
The heated and the holy  
Oh they're sitting there on high  
So secure with everything they're buying

You hold so tightly in your hand  
And all the while the distance grows between you and me  
I do not understand

In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
We wanted the the union oh the union of the woman, the woman and the man

In that tenderness I am floating away  
No certainty, nothing to rely on  
Holding still for a moment  
What a moment this is  
Oh for a moment of forgetting  
A moment of bliss  
Oh  
  
I can hear the distant thunder  
Of a million unheard souls  
Of a million unheard souls  
Watch each one reach for creature comfort  
For the filling of their holes  
  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man

In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
I feel the man in the woman and the woman in the man  
  
In the blood of Eden we have done everything we can

Dave Matthews Band,The Song That Jane Likes,/d/dave+matthews+band/song+that+jane+likes_20036607.html,"And in plays to write the wire in  
I'll come back again  
Torching time talking rhymes in  
I'll come back again  
  
Would you like to play  
With the thought of a friend  
In a distant passing stage  
While you lie around  
With your hands up and out  
So resigned you will fall down  
  
While you around here play  
Wild on the warm and far away  
While you around here play  
The days keep scribbling themselves in tidy lines  
  
Would you like to play  
With a fool holding hands  
With a one-eyed jack of spades  
While on the deck they sing  
All of the captain's cards are kings  
Still he and the queen are lost at sea  
I hope it isn't you or me  
  
And I'll be back 'round again  
Yes I'll walk in time with you old friend  
And we'll find that place  
That we had danced in so long ago  
And in plays to write the wire in  
I'll come back again  
Torching time talking rhymes in  
I'll come back again  
With this resigned the letter I sign

They sit home and write letters  
And when they visit once a year  
Well they both just sit there and stare

500 kinds of cigarettes

And I'm trying to write this letter to you  
About how much I care and why I just can't be there  
To draw your bath and comb...and comb your hair  
  
Last night in a nightspot  
Where things aren't so hot  
My friend said, ""I met a boy and I'm in love""  
I said, ""Oh really... What's this one's name?""  
She said, ""His first name is Homeboy""  
I said ""Could his last name be Trouble?""  
  
See how we are  
Ah Homeboy... Isn't that a Mexican name?

This world keeps spinning my rims still spinning  
Even though the money slow we still spinning

Let this world keep turning yeah my blunts still burning  
Same thing different day still burning  
In this crazy world and this dopes still selling

And I ain't never tried the shit imagine how that white feel  
But that don't even matter though trying to pay the light bill,  
Light bill, phone bill plus my granted nerve bills  
Feel like I should be taking off imagine how my nerves feel

Like time they go on and on  
I guess could learn to do the same  
I can wake up without you  
These two arms not around you  
Tell myself it was meant to be this way  
No matter how I try  
Some things I can't change

If you've got a fever, feed it  
And if you can't feed it, then why not blow

The call to arms to hammer at the gates  
To blow them wide throw evil to its fate  
  
All summers long the drills to build the machine  
To turn men from flesh and blood to steel  
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach  
From summer sands to Armageddon's reach  
  
Overlord, your master not your god  
The enemy coast dawning Grey with scud  
These wretched souls puking, shaking fear  
To take a bullet for those who sent them here  
  
The world's alight, the cliffs erupt in flame  
No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains  
Drowning men no chance for a warrior's fate  
A choking death enter hell's gate  
  
Sliding we go, only fear on our side  
To the edge of the wire,  
And we rush with the tide  
Oh the water is red,  
With the blood of the dead  
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive

They are relieved, the living wait their turn

The warrior tombs, lie open for us all

Left with no one to hold  
If love was a sport, we're not on the same team  
You and i are destined to lose  
If love was an ocean, then we are just a stream  
'Cause love isn't for me and you  
  
Why don't you go your way  
And I'll go mine  
Live your life  
And I'll live mine  
Baby you'll do well  
And I'll be fine  
'Cause we're better off separated  
  
Girl I know we had some good times  
It's sad but now, we gotta say goodbye  
Girl you know I love you, I can't deny  
Can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I  
I know it hurts, so much but it's best for us  
Somewhere along this winding road we lost the trust  
So I'll walk away, so you don't have to see me cry  
It's killing me so, why don't you go  
  
Why don't you go your way (oh)  
And I'll go mine (baby)  
Live your life (oh)  
And I'll live mine (I'll live mine)  
Baby you'll do well (I'll be fine)  
And I'll be fine  
'Cause we're better off, so much better off  
  
Go your way (Go your way)  
And I'll go mine (I'll go mine)  
Live your life (Your life)  
I'll live mine  
You'll do well (ohh hoo)  
And I'll be fine  
  
'Cause we're better off, so much better off  
So much better off  
Separated  
  
I'm sorry we didn't make it

I'm an Indian outlaw  
Half Cherokee and Choctaw  
My baby she's a Chippewa  
She's one of a kind  
  
All my friends call me Bear Claw  
Village cheatin' is my paw-paw  
He gets his orders from my maw-may  
She makes him walk the line  
  
You can find me in my wigwam  
I'll be beatin' on my tom-tom  
Pull out the pipe and smoke you some  
Hey and pass it around

I ain't lookin' for trouble  
We can ride my pony double  
Make your little heart bubble  
Like a glass of wine  
  
I remember the medicine man  
He caught runnin' water in my hands  
Drug me 'round by my headband  
Said I wasn't the kind

I can kill a deer or buffalo  
With just my arrow and my hickory bow  
From a hundred yards don't you know  
I do it all the time  
  
They all gather 'round my teepee  
Late at night tryin' to catch a peek  
At me in nothin' but my buffalo briefs  
I got em standin' in line

The hand of a golden giant man  
He's crushing my knuckles  
Splitting my skin, he says he will

He says  
Girl, it's your call  
You wanna fly  
You wanna fall  
So I shout  
I wanna get away from you  
As fast as I can  
I tell my feet to move it  
I hope they have a plan

So now I'm free  
Free  
From the big bad giant  
  
Who was stalking me  
Thank you feet, for guiding me  
I'm glad somehow I got brains down there, at least

Sometimes I am  
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss that giant man  
He was the line between pleasure and pain  
But me and the feet have some years to reclaim

Is that your lonely, in need of a friend  
  
Oh yeah sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you  
Oh yeah sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do  
  
And can't you see that it's true  
There's someone as lonely as you  
Trying so hard, so hard to get through  
And why can't everyone see the way that it really should be  
Why hide your feelings and suffer the pain  
  
Oh yeah, sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you  
Oh yeah, sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do  
  
You know that sorrow is a woman  
You know she'll make you feel sad

Will cushion the impact as you sink like a stone

Faith Hill,That's How Love Moves,/f/faith+hill/thats+how+love+moves_20052502.html,"It's such a mystery  
How she found something in me  
That I never knew was there  
But she uncovered it so easily  
  
She turned me like a season  
And I began to change  
She wrapped herself around me  
Now I'll never be the same  
  
That's how love works  
That's how love moves  
Like a river  
Running through you  
  
Sometimes it lifts you as high as heaven  
It consumes you  
But, that's a given  
That's how love moves  
  
I've seen walls that could never be broken  
Come tumbling down  
I've heard the voice of love  
Calling without making a sound  
  
See I was touched by an angel  
The day she took my hand  
You know she's the miracle  
That makes me everything that I am  
  
Sometimes it's just a whisper  
Sometimes it's a storm  
Sometimes it reaches forever  
With it's everlasting arms  
  
That's how love works  
That's how love moves  
Like a river  
Running through you  
  
Sometimes it lifts you as high as heaven  
It consumes you  
But, that's a given  
That's how love moves

How you really feel, but can you comprehend  
You could be just around the corner now  
Hoping this love is yet to be found

Can be right under my skin (right under my skin)  
I don't know where to begin  
Would I look the fool  
Should I play it cool  
Or jump right in  
  
How am I supposed to know  
Whether I should come or go  
Think it's time we let our feelings show  
We might let the moment just pass us by  
Then it's gone in the blink of an eye

Making love as lovely as she.

To you, He has given life to one,  
Isn't she lovely, and she's made it from love.

About the times when I don't have to say...:

I'm leaving on a jetplane, I', leaving on a jetplane.......(fade)

Tuning low like a radio  
Whispering goodbye

Softly potent, serene  
Vacant and shy

Under my skin and in my hair

Do it for the thrill.

Only when you're sleeping can you drift away.  
No one can hurt you.  
Listen to the secret of your dreams.  
Though you want to sleep forever  
Still you must return  
  
Hands of ice  
Down your spine.  
Are you sure you're alone?

Feel the grip  
Of a clinging vine.  
Are you sure you're alone?  
Are you sure you're alone?

Or the wind that's calling

And now that, that is all over  
All we've got is the silence  
In the deathcar, we're alive  
In the deathcar, we're alive

I felt that you still had your baby fat  
And a little taste of baby's breath  
Makes me forget about death

And she said losing love  
Is like a window in your heart  
Everybody sees you're blown apart  
Everybody sees the wind blow  
  
I'm going to Graceland  
Memphis Tennessee  
I'm going to Graceland  
Poor boys and pilgrims with families  
And we are going to Graceland  
  
And my traveling companions  
Are ghosts and empty sockets  
I'm looking at ghosts and empties  
But I've reason to believe  
We all will be received  
In Graceland  
  
There is a girl in New York City  
Who calls herself the human trampoline  
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying  
Or tumbling in turmoil I say  
Oh, so this is what she means  
She means we're bouncing into Graceland  
And I see losing love  
Is like a window in your heart  
Everybody sees you're blown apart  
Everybody sees the wind blow  
  
In Graceland, in Graceland  
I'm going to Graceland  
For reasons I cannot explain  
There's some part of me wants to see  
Graceland  
And I may be obliged to defend  
Every love, every ending  
Or maybe there's no obligations now  
Maybe I've a reason to believe  
We all will be received  
In Graceland

She shines her light where just before  
There was only  
A cold wind blowing  
She understands what makes me smile  
And lets me know that  
Without showing  
I need to tell her, need to show her  
How deep she goes  
  
Inside of me  
She is the stone that breaks the hard shell  
And rings out the loudest bell  
With whispered words that scream out  
All the peace in me  
  
Give that girl a diamond  
Yeah give that girl a diamond  
And say it's from me  
A blue reflected light  
Way past the darkest place  
My only private night  
Of fearful dreams  
She is stone that stabs my shield of steel  
The peace that she makes me feel  
With whispered words

Need to show her  
How deep she goes

How can I forget when we first touched?  
Never thought that I would want someone so much.  
I looked in your eyes and then I knew for sure  
You would be my love forevermore.  
As you slept, I kept thinking of the night we met.  
  
Memories come and go like a dream lost in the night,  
But I remember everything about you,  
How you came and changed my life.  
  
And how can I forget those wedding bells?  
You looked like an angel, I remember well  
How we danced all night and never touched the ground.

And when you cried, the tears were falling from my eyes

And how can I forget that night?

Quincy Punx,Be My Alibi,/q/quincy+punx/be+my+alibi_20607666.html,"  
A life of crimes not easy, sometimes you need some help  
Someone to share the risks with, and to help you spend the wealth  
Some one to run the shredder, or to help you dig a hole  
But lying on the witness stand's the most important role  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
When I come home at night With blood up to my elbows,  
Skin beneath my fingernails, and brains stuck to my toes,  
Let's get the story straight because the cops are on their way  
Just sit tight, and listen, and I'll tell you what to say.  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
Don't ask any question about the money in the closet  
You'll get your share later just foget you ever saw it  
Share and share alike, that's the way it's gotta be,  
Even if it's gonna make you an accessory  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
I'm gonna be indicted for that last bank robbery  
You've got to tell the jury that it really wasn't me  
Just remember what to say when you're on the stand  
I'm sure that everything will go exactly like we planned  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you

Gary Numan,In A Dark Place,/g/gary+numan/in+a+dark+place_20632042.html,"Something calls me  
From a dark place  
And so I pray every night  
Something knows me  
It whispers my name  
And I'm losing my faith  
I can feel it breathing  
But it feels like something dead and cold  
I can feel it waiting  
But it waits for something in my soul  
Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid  
So I beg God  
For salvation, for an angel  
Every night  
And I ask God  
Can He forgive me?  
And I want to believe  
I think I hear it laughing  
But it sounds like my voice lost and old  
I think it showed me Heaven  
And now I know why I'm scared to die  
Am I a fool in the dark, I don't know  
Am I the ghost in my dreams, I don't know  
Am I a shadow of life, I don't know  
Am I afraid of the truth, I don't know  
Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid  
So I ask for  
One small mercy?  
But it whispers 'Who are you?'  
So I ask God  
If He can save me?  
He says 'It's all too dark'

Arlo Guthrie,Won't Be Long,/a/arlo+guthrie/wont+be+long_20344616.html,"Not so long ago I set out on this road  
With my friends and my companions by my side  
And I think of you wherever I do go  
I'm a rambler, I ain't hard to satisfy  
  
[Chorus:]  
Won't be long till I am home again with you  
Just a few more miles to go  
Won't be long till I can get back on my own  
Won't be long till I can spend my time with you  
  
In the airport I'm standing in a line  
Search my pockets, check me out and I'm alright  
It's not hard but it ain't easy all the time  
To be in some other town most every night  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh, I miss the singing from porch banjo nights  
And when friends come by to pass the time away  
And when the winds that chill the Bershires in the night  
Heading east through Massachusetts toward the bay

To stand by me  
To see me through  
I was counting on you  
  
They moved the moon  
While I looked down  
When I looked away  
They changed the stars around  
  
I'm so confused  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know which way to turn  
I was counting on you  
  
They moved the moon  
While I looked down  
When I looked away  
They changed the stars around  
  
Can't you see me?  
Can't you hear me now?  
Don't you want a love that's true?  
Don't you know my heart belongs to you?  
  
I was counting on you  
To stand by me  
To see me through  
I was counting on you  
  
They moved the moon  
While I looked down  
When I looked away  
They changed the stars around  
  
They moved the moon  
I feel so strange  
While I looked down  
Everything I depended on  
When I looked away  
Has been rearranged  
They changed the stars around

Sees the world not the same as before  
We might as well just throw it all  
And live like there's no tomorrow

You might be gone before you know  
So live like there's no tomorrow-ain't gonna waste this life  
There's no tomorrow-you ain't gonna live it for me

In a whole new way  
Live fast cause if you don't take it  
You'll never make it

The Jam,The Combine,/j/jam/the+combine_20068920.html,"And life is very difficult, when you're in the crowd  
When you're in the crowd, you see things as they really are  
You can smell the fear and hate, generated by all around -  
I want to breakaway, but the ties are too strong  
want to go on holiday, but the crowd says I can't  
See life is very different, when you're in the crowd  
Oh, sometimes in the night, I wish I was faraway  
But then I realize, even escape will be in vain  
I want to close my eyes and be like the rest  
I mean, nobody wants to die, although the crowd say they do  
Look, life is very intricate, when you're in the crowd  
Life becomes the movies  
And everyone has a role  
It's easy being the actor  
When the combine's the only star -

And the dailies

Don't you know that game repeats game?  
So your best bet is to be straight with me.

If you won't talk, I'll walk.

There you go, cause your lies got old,  
Now look at you, there you go.

How you said goodbye to what's-her-name,

Had to get myself from around you,  
Cause my life was all about you.

Don't you wish you could turn the hands of time?  
Don't you wish that you still were mine?  
Don't you wish I'd take you back?  
Don't you wish that things were simple like that, oh?  
Didn't miss a good thing till it's gone,  
But I knew it wouldn't be long,  
Till you came running back,  
Missing my love, there you go!

There you go, looking pitiful,  
Just because I let you go.  
There you go, talking about you want me back,

That you love me so, why I let you go,

Jimmy Buffett,Love In The Library,/j/jimmy+buffett/love+in+the+library_20071955.html,"On the corner of Government and Bay Avenue  
The old doomsday fanatic wore a crown of kudzu  
Sirens where wailing in the gulf coastal heat  
And it seemed like the whole world was in forced retreat  
I paid no attention, revolved through the door  
Passed the newspaper rack on the worn marble floor  
Near civil war history my heart skipped a beat  
She was standing on fiction stretched high on bare feet  
  
Love in the library, quiet and cool  
Love in the library, there are no rules  
Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime  
I fell in love in the library once upon a time  
  
I was the pirate and she was the queen  
Sir Francis and Elizabeth the best there's ever been  
Then she strolled past my table and stopped at the stairs  
Then sent me a smile as she reached for Flaubert  
  
Love in the library, quiet and cool  
Love in the library, there are no rules  
Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime  
I fell in love in the library once upon a time  
  
She gathered her books, walked while she read  
Words never spoken but so much was said  
You can read all you want into this rendezvous  
But it's safer than most things that lovers can do  
Well stories have endings and fantasies fade  
The guard by the door starts drawing the shade  
So write your own ending and hope they come true  
For the lovers and strangers on Bay Avenue  
  
Love in the library, quiet and cool  
Love in the library, there are no rules  
Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime  
I fell in love in the library once upon a time

Just a bunch of matter  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then I don't want  
To be either  
I wanna be next to you  
Black and gold  
Black and gold

I looked up  
Into the grey sky  
And see a thousand eyes  
Staring back  
And all around  
These golden beacons  
I see nothing but black  
  
I feel a way of something  
Beyond them  
I don't see  
What I can feel  
If vision  
Is the only validation  
Then most of my life  
Isn't real  
  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then the stars  
Don't even matter  
Now I'm filled  
To the top with fear  
But it's all  
Just a bunch of matter  
'cause if you're not  
Really here  
Then I don't want  
To be either

When he woke up all alone  
A train's leavin' town and that lonesome old sound  
Is chilling me right to the bone.  
  
A song is playing I can barely hear  
About a love that's gone wrong  
The freezing rain on my window pane  
Listen they're playing my song.  
  
Taps being played by a soldier's grave  
So sad it torments your soul  
Just listen to that north wind moan  
Tonight it's so dark and cold.  
  
Somewhere a siren cuts through the night  
Sounds like a whole world's gone wrong  
Thunder just warned but it's coming a storm  
Listen they're playing my song

Dizzy and Bird gave us this song  
They called it ""A Night In Tunisia""

It was new and very strange  
Blew the squares right off the stage  
Few could play along  
But the melody still lingers on  
  
Max and Miles to name just two  
Together they grew  
The music was young and strong  
And the melody still lingers on  
  
They paved the way for generations  
From Coltrane to Stevie  
No one could stop the winds of change  
Without them where'd we be?  
  
The Duke and the Prez were there before  
The past you can't ignore  
The torch is lit, we'll keep the flame  
And the melody remains the same  
  
In the 40's  
A night in Tunisia  
In the 40's  
A night in Tunisia  
In the 40's  
A night in Tunisia  
In the 40's  
A night in Tunisia

Tracy Chapman,Be Careful Of My Heart,/t/tracy+chapman/be+careful+of+my+heart_20140235.html,"You and your sweet smile  
You and your tantalizing ways  
You and your honey lips  
You and all the sweet things that they say  
You and your wild wild ways  
One day you just up and walked away  
You left me hurting  
  
But I can forgive you for that now  
You taught me something  
Something took half my life to learn  
When you give all yourself away  
Just tell them to be careful of your heart  
  
Be careful of my heart, heart  
Be careful of this heart of mine  
Be careful of my heart, heart  
It just might break and send some splinters flying  
Be careful of my heart, heart  
Be careful  
  
You you you  
You you you  
You you you  
Took my love  
Thought you took it all  
  
You you you  
You you you  
You you you  
Took my love  
And now you're gone  
  
But I'm not breaking down  
And I'm not falling apart  
I just lost a little faith  
When you broke my heart  
Given a chance I might try it again  
But I wouldn't risk it all this time  
  
I'd save  
A little love for myself  
Enough for my heart to mend  
A little love for myself  
One day I just might love again  
One day some sweet smile might turn my head  
One day I just might give all myself away  
One day  
One day  
One day

Baby, ain't I good to you  
Nothing in this world too good for a girl, so good and true  
Whoa, baby, ain't I good to you?  
I bought you a fur coat for Christmas  
And a diamond ring, yes I did  
And a big Cadillac car, and everything  
What makes me treat you the way that I do  
It must be love, baby  
That's why I'm so good to you  
I bought you a fur coat for Christmas

And a great big Eldorado and everything

Wishbone Ash,You,/w/wishbone+ash/you_20147283.html,"You  
Were looking for somebody new.  
You  
Were looking for someone to help yourself to,  
In the sunset of your long, illustrious career.  
You  
The way you played so hard to get.  
You  
So funny to watch, but you did not forget  
What you were looking for - a star,  
And this was the best one so far.  
  
Now you found your sugar daddy,  
You found your sugar pop.  
We applaud the way you pulled it off,  
The way you came out on top.  
  
You  
Got more than you had bargained for.  
Catch 22 that as you opened  
You closed the door.  
They all thought you were digging for gold and more.  
  
You  
Moved in your bags and said,""I'm here to stay"".  
Gossip everywhere about how hard you earned your pay.  
But I just laughed at you and your style  
I hope you're happy for a while.  
  
You  
Oh, I love you for what you are.  
You  
You give it everything  
It's you who are the star  
Of this song.  
Don't get me wrong  
Just stay the way you are.  
  
You.

Chain the earth and chain the sun  
Break the hourglass  
Make the stars fall into line  
Suspend the end of time  
No, not tonight  
I'll not give in without a fight  
And I'll rage against this wind  
For even a moment more of the day  
I will...

Run proud, run free  
Never set the sun on me  
Race hard play mean  
Anger's the symphony of screams  
A thousand roses on the hill  
A thousand lips to taste  
The darkness breathes a hateful sigh  
Goes forth to murder dreams  
Voices crying cold and dark  
My name is in the sky  
Shadows lenghten, sun sinks low  
The trees are frozen gold  
I won't give in!!!

You climb a flight of twisted stairs

So slick it should have been a crime

And fills up with light)  
And then from somewhere deep inside you  
Some frozen stuff begins to crack

You're feelng calm and crisp and strong

Miley Cyrus,My Sad Christmas Song,/m/miley+cyrus/my+sad+christmas+song_21105348.html,"[Intro]  
Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
I've had it stuck in my head all day long  
I wrote it in the car on my ride home  
Cause I knew I'd walk in the door and I'd be alone  
Why'd I even put up that fuckin' tree?  
If there's no one here that's gonna see  
Just how pretty she looks on Christmas Eve  
Cause there's no one here next to me  
  
[Chorus 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I light another bong  
I turn on the radio  
I binge watch our favorite shows  
This year feels kind of lame  
But the last one was the same  
But the holiday spirit they say  
Is taking off on a plane  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 2]  
I always thought that Santa was kind of cute  
There's something about his beard, big belly, and boots  
I left Santa more than cookies this year  
I thought he might appreciate a few beers  
That's why I'm always on the naughty list  
He said cause when I get drunk, I'm always showing my tits  
He leaned in for a kiss and he got real near  
I had to stop Santa and say ""My true love ain't here""  
  
[Chorus 2]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I rip another bong  
I never been good at making plans  
Next year, I'm gonna be with my man  
My little sister says I'm the Grinch  
But my mom thinks I'm just a bitch  
Why did you have to go?  
We were under the mistletoe  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala  
  
[Bridge]  
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas, know I miss you so  
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas, know I miss you so  
  
[Outro]  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas  
(Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala)  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas  
(Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala)  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas  
(Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala)  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas

That my days would be brighter, if I could learn to hide  
The feelings that I have for you keep hurtin me inside  
  
Then my day begins with simple thoughts of you  
Hoping my tomorrow would be me and you  
Sharing dreams with each other  
And making them come true  
Holding one another, saying all I need is you  
  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you, you will always be there  
But if you go and leave me  
This I swear is true, my love will always be with you  
  
Now my nights would end with just one wish that's you  
To hold me in the dark and help me make it through  
Cause the pain that's inside me, would simply melt away  
If I had you here with me and promise me you'd stay

Bon Jovi,Another Reason To Believe,/b/bon+jovi/another+reason+to+believe_20525224.html,"Love lives in New York City  
He got a place off of the park  
Heard he was standing in the ruins  
And in his hands a broken heart  
He called an army of his angels  
I heard they had to hide their wings  
It was them who brought you water  
If you listen closely I know you can hear  
The choir singing  
  
Chorus  
Hey, hallelujah, baby  
Rise Up  
Hold out your hands and reach out  
Higher  
Get up on your feet  
Rise Up  
Let it flow though you, baby  
Run it through your veins  
Like a healing rain  
Everywhere you'll see  
Another reason to believe  
  
I saw him down south of Canal Street  
Right there in a mother's eyes  
At a table in a restaurant window  
In a taxi passing by  
Love went running up the stairwell  
When the sky came falling down  
It was him in a newborn baby's cry  
He was there to make that sound  
That keeps this whole world spinning 'round  
  
Chorus  
Rise Up  
Hold out your hands and reach out  
Higher  
Get up on your feet  
Rise Up  
Let it flow though you, baby  
Run it through your veins  
Like a healing rain  
Everywhere you'll see  
Another reason to believe  
  
It's different than it was before  
Now we need it even more  
Fire's falling from the sky  
Innocence just said goodbye  
It may never be the same  
Maybe it was time to change  
A time to grieve  
A time to cry  
A time to live  
A time to fly

Though I never knew you at all  
You had the grace to hold yourself  
While those around you crawled  
They crawled out of the woodwork  
And they whispered into your brain  
They set you on the treadmill  
And they made you change your name  
  
And it seems to me you lived your life  
Like a candle in the wind  
Never knowing who to cling to  
When the rain set in  
And I would have liked to have known you  
But I was just a kid  
Your candle burned out long before  
Your legend ever did  
  
Loneliness was tough  
The toughest role you ever played  
Hollywood created a superstar  
And pain was the price you paid  
Even when you died  
Oh the press still hounded you  
All the papers had to say  
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude  
  
And it seems to me you lived your life  
Like a candle in the wind  
Never knowing who to cling to  
When the rain set in  
And I would have liked to have known you

More than just our Marilyn Monroe  
  
And it seems to me you lived your life

Never knowing who to cling to  
When the rain set in  
And I would have liked to have known you

Out of the blue  
No more pain  
I don't mind  
If it's only  
A passing craze  
Throwaway lines  
Often ring true  
If I were you  
  
I would stay  
For a little while  
I you were me  
Would you walk out  
In style?

Rush,Annihilation Gun,/r/rush/annihilation+gun_20474733.html,"Weapons of mass distraction are used by politicians and conspiracy theorists  
Within their reach  
The entire solar system withstanding geographical combat  
Annihilation is one source of political free speech  
In a world of nuclear devastation, doom and deteonation  
In a world of curiosity beyond the imagination  
Every man and woman decides to hide the conspiracy behind global armageddon  
When the entire planet prepares for destruction  
Connecting their minds with others through telepathy  
In the common sense of human curiosity  
Destroy the entire world and get every man and woman out of nowhere  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look out for everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere  
  
People use their super-human powers to discover the dark and dangerous world  
Of hypothetical secrets  
In most cases, sometimes he or she confess why they regret  
In my opinion, gubernatorial fear is far from over  
The conspiracy is nowhere beyond our greatest self-destructive endeavor  
More and more human beings make connections  
And it's part of an all-out worldwide chain reaction  
Keep staring at the annihilation gun before it's too late  
One year from now, the entire world's about to detonate  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look out for everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere  
  
All nations will self-destruct, according to research scientists  
The bomb will explode in many countries where nuclear weapons exist  
Search for the enemy within your secret human desire  
Stare at the fugutives caught in the crossfire  
Stare at the anti-terrorsts standing higher  
Look at the dangerous cheaters taking a stand  
Nuclear detours fall pass the right human hand  
Find one or more anti-terrorism activist fighting for freedom  
Be sure the hidden enemy will escape from the kingdom  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere

Only sound, only sound that you hear is ""no""  
You never saw it coming  
Slipped when you started running  
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I  
  
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh  
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade  
Wish I could make it better  
Someday you won't remember  
This pain you thought would last forever and ever  
  
And there you'll stand, ten feet tall  
I will say, I knew it all along  
Your eyes' wider than distance  
This life's sweeter than fiction  
  
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh  
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes  
They never saw it coming  
You hit the ground running  
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say  
  
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on  
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong  
And in this perfect weather  
It's like we don't remember  
The rain we thought would last forever and ever  
  
And there you'll stand, ten feet tall  
I will say, I knew it all along  
Your eyes' wider than distance  
This life's sweeter than fiction  
  
There you'll stand, next to me  
All at once, the rest is history  
Your eyes' wider than distance  
This life's sweeter than fiction, fiction  
  
I'll be one of the many saying,  
Look at you now, look at you now, now  
I'll be one of the many saying,  
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud  
I'll be one of the many saying,  
Look at you now, look at you now, now  
I'll be one of the many saying,  
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud  
  
And when they call your name  
And they put your picture in a frame  
You know that I'll be there time and again  
'Cause I loved you when, when you  
  
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh  
Only sound, only sound that you heard was ""no""  
Now in this perfect weather  
It's like we don't remember  
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)  
  
There you'll stand, ten feet tall

Your eyes' wider than distance

There you'll stand next to me  
All at once, the rest is history  
Your eyes' wider than distance  
This life's sweeter than fiction, fiction

Ambling along the corridor  
I am disappointed  
  
Now he comes backwards towards me  
Honey stays stuck on the garter  
I am disappointed, totally disappointed

The human has bent down  
And moved into a good light  
I show him what you can do  
And I start to cry  
  
The human stammers a prayer  
Out of fear because it goes worse for me  
He tried to bend down even more  
Tears run up the back  
  
Bend down...  
  
Bend down, I command you  
Turn your face away from me

Bend down once more

Some say love, it is a hunger  
An endless, aching need  
I say love, it is a flower  
And you, it's only seed  
  
It's the heart, afraid of breaking  
That never learns to dance  
It's the dream, afraid of waking  
That never takes the chance  
  
It's the one who won't be taken  
Who cannot seem to give  
And the soul afraid of dyin'  
That never learns to live  
  
When the night has been too lonely  
And the road has been too long  
And you think that love is only  
For the lucky and the strong  
  
Just remember, in the winter  
Far beneath the bitter snows  
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love  
In the spring, becomes the rose

And I don't get waves of missing you anymore  
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes  
Never getting dry so I get high smoke in the day then I sleep with the light
on  
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye  
And I'm still drunk by the end of the night  
I don't drink like everybody else  
End up forgetting things about myself  
I'm stubborn I'm forward head's just blocked  
My head's still with you but my hearts just not  
  
So am I close to you anymore if it's over  
And there's no chance that we'll work it out  
That's why you and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied  
  
Everybody said that we'll be together forever but I know that  
I never wanna settle down come around break up the love like Lego now  
Never wanna turn into another like you  
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views  
Everything's great but everything's short  
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus  
Now I'm in position to be another stalker  
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward  
Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous  
On the surface  
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it  
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts  
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative  
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss  
  
So am I close to you anymore if it's over  
And there's no chance that we'll work it out  
Oh you and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
  
Because if I was gonna go somewhere I'd be there by now  
And maybe I can let myself down oh  
And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground  
Keep looking around to make sure I'm not he only one to feel low  
Because if you want I'll take you in my arms  
And keep you sheltered from all that I've done wrong  
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one  
But I know that god made another one of me  
To love you better than I ever will  
  
'Cause you and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U-N-I

Cause just like them two door Fords  
Damn, they don't make 'em like you no more

Them boys cool, me I'm on fire  
Know whats on my mind, tryna see whats on yours tonight  
Tonight, tonight  
Move slow, cause you wanna live fast

Life is a test so before the night pass get right  
Get right

Gloria Estefan,Oye,/g/gloria+estefan/oye_10133163.html,"Take me only for what I am  
You've got a right to speak your mind  
You've gotta take a stand  
No one has the right to say  
This is right or that is wrong  
It isn't just one way  
Find common ground  
Go in between  
Things aren't always what they seem  
Someday it'll be alright  
Changes happen overnight  
People, let's give each other room  
If we're gonna work it out  
We better make it soon  
Love is love is such a common word  
When it's pride we mistake for love  
Isn't that absurd  
Why always take  
The upper hand  
It's better to understand  
Someday it'll be alright  
Changes happen overnight  
Someday it'll be alright  
Changes happen overnight  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
I believe in love but with no conditions  
Oye mi canto  
And giving in sometimes  
Doesn't make it submission  
Oye mi canto  
Hate is so common it's almost tradition  
Oye mi canto  
Come on let's leave it behind  
And make that transition  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto

Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's New Orleans Rag,/b/bob+dylan/bob+dylans+new+orleans+rag_20151228.html,"By Bob Dylan  
  
I was sittin' on a stump  
Down in New Orleans,  
I was feelin' kinda low down,  
Dirty and mean.  
Along came a fella  
And he didn't even ask.  
He says, ""I know of a woman  
That can fix you up fast. ""  
I didn't think twice,  
I said like I should,  
""Let's go find this lady  
That can do me some good. ""  
We walked across the river  
On a sailin' spree  
And we came to a door  
Called one-oh-three.  
  
I was just about ready  
To give it a little knock  
When out comes a fella  
Who couldn't even walk.  
He's linkin' and a-slinkin',  
Couldn't stand on his feet,  
And he moaned and he groaned  
And he shuffled down the street.  
Well, out of the door  
There comes another man.  
He wiggled and he wobbled,  
He couldn't hardly stand.  
He had this frightened  
Look in his eyes,  
Like he just fought a bear,  
He was ready to die.  
  
Well, I peeked through the key crack,  
Comin' down the hall  
Was a long-legged man  
Who couldn't hardly crawl.  
He muttered and he uttered  
In broken French,  
And he looked like he'd been through  
A monkey wrench.  
  
Well, by this time  
I was a-scared to knock,  
I was a-scared to move,  
I's in a state of shock.  
I hummed a little tune  
And I shuffled my feet  
And I started walkin' backwards  
Down that broad street.  
Well, I got to the corner,  
I tried my best to smile.  
I turned around the corner  
And I ran a bloody mile.  
Man, I wasn't runnin'  
'Cause I was sick,  
I was just a-runnin'  
To get out of there quick.  
  
Well, I tripped right along  
And I'm a-wheezin' in my chest.  
I musta run a mile  
In a minute or less.  
I walked on a log  
And I tripped on a stump,  
I caught a fast freight  
With a one-arm jump.  
So, if you're travelin' down  
Louisiana way,  
And you feel kinda lonesome  
And you need a place to stay,  
Man, you're better off  
In your misery  
Than to tackle that lady  
At one-oh-three.

In pastures of green  
The sun on your withers  
The wind in your mane

For what lies ahead  
The run for the roses so red

The fire of a mare  
And the strength of a stud  
It's breeding and it's training  
And it's something unknown  
That drives you  
And carries you home

Diana Ross,Love Child,/d/diana+ross/love+child_20809059.html,"You think that I don't feel love  
But what I feel for you is real love  
In other's eyes I see reflected  
A hurt, scorned, rejected  
  
Love child, never meant to be  
Love child, born in poverty  
Love child, never meant to be  
Love child, take a look at me  
  
I started my life in an old, cold run down tenement slum  
My father left, he never even married mom  
I shared the guilt my mama knew  
So afraid that others knew I had no name  
  
This love we're contemplating  
Is worth the pain of waiting  
We'll only end up hating  
The child we maybe creating  
  
Love child, never meant to be  
Love child, (scorned by) society  
Love child, always second best  
Love child, different from the rest  
  
Mm, baby (hold on, hold on, just a little bit)  
Mm, baby (hold on, hold on, just a little bit)  
I started school, in a worn, torn, dress that somebody threw out  
I knew the way it felt, to always live in doubt  
To be without the simple things  
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me  
  
Don't think that I don't need you  
Don't think I don't want to please you  
No child of mine 'll be bearing  
The name of shame I've been wearing  
  
Love child, love child, never quite as good  
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood  
  
But I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you

Got no problem with you, niggas, get it how you live it, bro  
It's a cold world, these mean streets will shiver you  
All I asks is for the same respect that I be giving you

That boy be on his shoot first, never mind the trivia  
My advice, don't mess with his man, word to Nivea  
We go back to when we got that white from Bolivia  
We was candy shopping before 50 and Olivia  
That's when you would go uptown 'cause you had to re' there  
Everybody broke back then, you had to repair  
Drug dealing was cool back then, you had to beware  
That was the 90's, y'all wouldn't get it, you had to be there  
That's why I'm glad to be here, some of us never made it  
It's hard to get off the ground, y'all think I just levitated  
Y'all think it was all love and nobody ever hated  
Y'all think 'cause I never stated I never been devastated  
All y'all see is sun shining, think I was never shaded  
Y'all think these calendar models is all that I ever dated  
Nigga, nothing was the same, HOT 97 played it  
Every day they made it that I stayed with 57 played it  
Can't trust nobody, the crib is heavy gated  
You ask why? I tell them even heaven's gated  
You know why? 'Cause when you good the devil hate it  
And even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted  
Attention, I never paid it, me and this clever lady  
She brains, do some things, then we lay together faded  
And while I chill, loaded up a steel  
Just wishing a nigga would but knowing a nigga will  
But for real, nigga, good is how you feel  
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will  
Still, I don't owe these niggas nothing, put that in a nigga will  
  
Damned if you do them, if you don't, don't, don't, don't  
They don't have a hand on your head of what you're doing now  
You're damned if you do them, if you don't  
People sit around and judge you anyway  
Don't, don't, don't

Reflects back on yourself  
Then it gets you wondering'  
If it means anything  
  
And if the money isn't right  
Can I be yours tonight?  
I've had a pretty hard life  
I've had a pretty hard life  
For such an easy heart  
  
You move away when you're young  
They take away where you're from  
And all the things out in the trees  
Fall away in to the breeze  
  
And if the money isn't right  
Can I be yours tonight?  
I've had a pretty hard life  
I've had a pretty hard life  
For such an easy heart

Blew my hole in the past  
Niggarette gave me gonorrhea  
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina  
Boy you shoulda seen her  
She had a Babyface creamer Purina's  
Called up talkin' Tina  
I put my dick in a womb  
She blew my head like a balloon  
I had her walkin' on the moon  
  
Yo, I seen you at the five and dime wastin' your time  
Oh you shine, I'm lookin' at your ass from behind  
You walked by smellin' like watermelon  
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swellin'  
My nuts start yellin', excuse my prick  
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick  
My medicine is can I walk with you, fantasy  
After that we can cheat  
Laid on the bed, handcuffed with hard meat  
Long stroke smack it, smack it then broke  
Nothin' can't stop my continuous poke  
Compound porno flick music  
Daddy came with it when I wrote it  
  
Dirt Dog be bouncin' on bitches like frog  
I pollute the air up like smog, bitch  
I'm up my jacuzzi, peepin' this smoothie  
My bitch is a floozy, Dirt Dog ain't choosy  
Pussy move me, pretty black dick up in the booty  
I like it muddy or swampy  
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky  
Don't got no fuckin' room me and my momma and my TV  
Blackberry squeeze, bitch who a tease  
Titties small, I got used to the squeeze  
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch  
Old hen please can't get a bank of these welfare cheese  
Now to blow fifty G's overseas  
I'm doin' the breeze, in my 850  
  
Suicidal  
She been in more hotels than bibles  
Idle worshippin' bitch wasn't the type to make bridle  
Sprung, on how the bitch maneuvered her tongue  
From the top of his dick, to the bottom of his ass split  
I told the God to jet quick this wicked bitch was a harlot  
But had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web  
She wasn't choosy fucked for a movie and a loose leaf  
Cigarette, pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons  
Big ass in tight denim  
Had the most faithful niggas sendin' her gifts to women and enjoyed  
To watch relationships get destroyed  
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void and shameless  
Her attitude was blameless  
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her name list  
Her obsession, caused niggas to get, the ass cheek injection  
The bitched lied, said she had urinary tract infection  
I tried to warn em, and bomb em, but she conned em  
Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom  
  
You people are all trying to achieve the impossible  
(That's exactly what we've done)  
But you'll fail, and you'll all die  
(If we die, the next generation will fight them too  
And the one after them, for as long as they must  
And eventually we shall succeed)

Always think twice  
Don't go and throw your love away  
To some man just for the night  
Promises, promises, don't waste your time  
If his intentions don't feel right

Don't get a bad reputation  
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold

Don't need a bad reputation

To find someone who  
Was looking in the same direction  
That you pointed to  
I'll never turn and walk away  
If my heart gives me the sign  
When the one, comes along  
He'll understand  
That the wait was worth the while

Don't get a bad reputation  
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Don't need a bad reputation

Hoping you might change  
Your mind and call me up  
To say how much you need me too  
  
And though you're leaving me no other choice  
That to turn and walk away  
Look over your shoulder, I'll be there  
You can count on me to stay

And Macheath has got a knife

Now see the shark, how red his fins are  
As he slashes at his prey  
Mack the Knife wears fancy gloves  
Which gives a minimum away  
  
By the Thames' turbid waters  
Men abruptly tumble down  
Well is it plague, or is it cholera  
Or because Macky's in town?  
  
And the child bride, in her nighty  
Whose assailant's still at large  
Violated in her slumbers  
Macky how much did you charge?  
  
In the ghastly fire in Soho  
Seven children had a go  
In the crowd stands Mack the Knife  
But he isn't asked and he don't know

When you drew the breath of life

The first time that you cried

I was very near  
And there's something now  
That I want you to hear

You will always be a child  
In my eyes  
And when you need some love  
My arms are open wide  
And even when you're growing old  
I hope you realize  
You will always be a child  
In my eyes  
I was there the first time  
That you prayed  
And I heard  
All the promises you made  
And when you fell before Me  
Crying, Father, I have sinned  
I picked you up  
And held you close again

I was a cowboy with a throat full of sand  
I called her Honey when she brought my whiskey  
And later I left there holding her hand  
Then we walked down the street to a tumble down hotel  
Where she had a room on a cold second floor  
And that room looked like hell just a bed and a table  
A shade on the window and a lock on the door  
I said to myself she's cheap and she's easy  
But she don't look half bad I'll stay for the night  
But I'll leave when it's early cause I've got this feeling  
She won't look so good in the bright morning light  
[ harmonica ]  
I've known some devils and I've known some angels  
I once had a woman on the Mexico line  
But I've never been touched like that woman touched me  
She lay there beside me and crawled in my mind  
And we talked and we smoked and made love till mornin'  
The sun come a streamin' through a hole in the shade  
And it fell like a spotlight on her face and her body  
And it hung like a halo round the bed where we lay  
I said to myself she's cheap and she's easy  
But she don't look half bad I guess I'll stay for the night  
But I'll tell you boys that was five years ago and Lord God what a woman  
She still looks as good in the bright morning light

The powers that be made you a martyr  
Conspiracy led you to slaughter

Content to sit and watch the motions of your life

You cut yourself open so people would adore you  
  
They all bought into your contrived sincerity  
And how you wore your heart and soul right on your sleeve  
Laughing sarcastically  
You turned your back on the people who adored you  
  
Self-absorbed exhaustion  
Self-esteem distortion  
Self-infused extortion  
Self-serving abortion

Someday he'll do it all  
  
Well the doctor says, I've got bad news  
Afraid there's nothing we can do  
And all at once the tears are in his eys  
He'll never start living  
Never really start living  
Yeah he had big plans  
But there's no time on his hands  
To start living  
  
When he sees the pearly gates  
He'll really start living

Everyone's confused  
  
Caught in the middle, of life and fantasy  
Caught in the middle, is where you seem to be  
  
Everyone around is sad, but, they analyze you mad  
Sayin' you've lost your mind  
  
Seems their lives have been abused  
With a risk of being used, no happiness to find

I walk back blind into my cold dreamhouse  
And I think about the damage  
I put the big light out  
I sit down smoking on my basement floor  
I hear footsteps up above me  
They are right outside my front door  
The only place that I want to be  
Is watching you move up on top of me  
The only sound that I want to hear  
Is the rain against my window as you whisper in my ear  
Baby, you know I love it when you call me baby  
I go upstairs and find my twelve-year-old  
She's got tears running down her face  
Sitting sad at my piano  
She sings soft words from that old Beatles song  
And I think about my yesterday and all the things I did wrong  
The only place that I want to be  
Is watching you sweet dream in bed right next to me  
The only sound that I want to hear  
Is the rain against my window as I pull you near  
Don't give up on me  
Baby, can't you you see?  
We could make this be the way it used to be  
Don't give up on me  
I wish I could make you see  
That I am changing everyday, trying to build a better me  
We could make this be the way it's supposed to be  
Don't give up on me  
I stand out in the rain where I watched you drive away  
I never thought I would live to see  
This fucked-up day  
I stand out in the rain in the middle of the night  
I wish that it could wash away the beast inside  
The only thing I want to do is kiss you when I am coming deep inside of you  
The only sound that I want to hear  
Is the rain against my window as I hold you  
Don't give up on me  
Oh baby, can't you see?  
We could make this be the way it used to be  
Don't give up on me

He was calling my name.  
Searchin' for me.  
I always turned away.  
Not wanting to believe  
I have a need for Him.  
Feeling this emptiness.  
Not knowing he could fill.  
Drowning in my efforts to find comfort.  
I searched and strived for the answer.  
But every step I fell and the earth crumbled underneath me.  
Now I found this rock.  
This stable place.  
The pain has gone away.  
I place my hope in no other.  
My heart, it cries, it toils inside me.  
Wantin' all to have this life.  
Wanting all to know this love,  
But I'm reminded of my turning.  
Closing my eyes.  
Running the other way, but I've decided.  
I open my eyes to find more than I was looking for.  
My mind screams.  
Knowing this is for all,  
But not all I want I've found.

Dig up the coffins, unscrew the bolts  
No better reminder, no strong enough salts  
To show this pitiful few that we've missed the last waltz

Like the roller coaster ride slowed down to a serious debate

I paid the bills  
I took those pills  
It was wind in her sails  
She climbed so high  
I don't know why  
High,  
On her own  
  
And I know  
She's in the air  
And I don't want it to go  
I can feel her love  
But I don't want it to go

The memory comes of a distant beach  
Pale sand stretching far from reach  
It was then I found my princess of the sand  
As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet  
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet  
She came to me and I saw in her eyes  
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes  
I called her my princess of the sand  
She stared at me and my mind was in a maze  
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze  
She moved her mouth but there came no sound  
The message she brought can never be found  
But I called her my princess of the sand  
One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face  
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace  
Where she went or came from who can know  
Or if she'll ever return to help me know  
Who she is, my princess of the sand  
Sometime when the summer nights come back  
I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track  
I'll look around, hope to find  
That strange young dream, close behind  
I'll call her my princess of the sand

And don't you ask me why, 'cause I just think its fun  
I hate the politically correct  
I hate jocks and I hate rednecks  
I hate the corporate fucking clones  
I hate faggots and homophobes

I hate daddies and I hate mommies  
I hate straightedgers and I hate drunks  
I hate skinhead and I hate punks

Let your heart be light.  
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight.  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas,  
Make the Yuletide gay.  
Next year all our troubles will be miles away.  
  
Once again as in olden days,  
Happy golden days of yore.  
Faithful friends who were dear to us,  
Will be near to us once more.  
  
Someday soon we all will be together,  
If the fates allow.  
Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow.

Pick it up  
And throw it away all right  
I got the perfect steal  
A cleaner love  
With a dirty feel all right  
Fall out and take the bait  
Eat the fruit  
And kiss the snake goodnight  
  
Common ruse dirty face  
Pretty noose is pretty hate  
And I don't like  
What you got me hanging from  
  
Let your motor race  
Pick it up  
And get this mother gone  
Out from and far away  
The wooden snake  
This thing has got me on  
  
Diamond rope silver chain  
Pretty noose is a pretty pain  
And I don't like  
What you got me hanging from  
  
I don't care what you got  
I don't care what you need  
I don't want anything  
And I don't like what  
You got me hanging from

Places to hide in the dusty gloom  
A noisy clock and a silver spoon  
A china cup on the mantlepiece  
Gathering dust as it did in the east  
And just outside lies the garden of peace  
Oh, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in this garden has come true  
A mirror pond reflects the dawn  
Over the banks, 'cross the emerald lawn  
A breeze has come and I'm carried along  
So follow the path through the knowing trees  
And each time you laugh, it is love you release  
That love will come back in the garden of peace  
So, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in the garden has come true  
Oh, tell me is this really true

She wants the boys to notice  
Her rainbows, and her ponies  
She was educated  
But could not count to ten  
How she got lots of different horses  
By lots of different men  
And I say  
  
Liberate your sons and daughters  
The bush is high  
But in the hole there's water  
You can get some, when they give it  
Nothing sacred, but it's a living  
  
Hey ho here she goes  
Either a little too high or a little too low  
Got no self-esteem and vertigo  
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy  
Hey ho here she goes  
Either a little too loud or a little too close  
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat  
And she thinks she's made of candy  
  
Ring a ring of roses  
Whoever gets the closest  
She comes and she goes  
As the war of the roses  
Mother was a victim  
Father beat the system  
By moving bricks to Brixton  
And learning how to fix them  
Liberate your sons and daughters  
The bush is high  
But in the hole there's water  
As you win  
She'll be the Hollywood love  
And if it don't feel good  
What are you doing this for  
Now tell me  
  
Hey ho here she goes  
Either a little too high or a little too low  
Got no self-esteem and vertigo

Hiding away  
Behind all those misty thunder clouds

To spend my time  
Looking for you  
For you are my one reality  
When I'm dead and gone  
Your light will shine eternally  
Sunny rain, shine my way  
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun  
You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear  
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun

My world was three foot, seven inch tall  
When you were young  
There was no world at all

who's been livin' too long alone  
Follow your heart  
  
follow your rainbow  
And one day you'll find  
You are not alone

I took advantage of your sweet love  
Don't just hand me a lifetime of sadness  
'Cause there's so little of beauty  
  
Oh baby, one chain don't make no prison  
Two wrongs don't make no right  
One rain don't make no river  
One punch don't make no fight  
  
Can't you spare me a little affection  
Would that be asking too much of you  
Don't point love in another direction  
I swear I'll make it all up to you  
  
Oh baby, one chain don't make no prison  
Two wrongs don't make no right  
One rain don't make no river  
One punch don't make no fight  
  
There's a bed I'm keeping room in for you  
There's a lot I know I gotta do  
Don't let as simple misunderstanding  
Be a mountain that we can't move  
  
Oh, one chain don't make no prison  
Two wrongs don't make no right  
One rain don't make no river  
One punch don't make no fight  
  
One chain don't make no prison

I do dear, I do  
I wish for you the stars, babe  
I wish for you the moon  
  
You can sit, and you can drink your champagne  
With your gibbering goon  
I hope he's being good to you  
I do dear, I do  
  
Ain't no whirlwind below your wing  
Wish that you will keep safe  
Up there in your leather babe  
With your ivory and [?]  
  
Things down here are fragmatic  
In fact they've exploded all over the room  
I think everything's a little off-center, babe  
I do dear, I do  
  
You said, that to love me you must set me free  
Now, that may all be very well  
Still I miss you baby  
More than words can ever tell  
  
Sometimes I can not sleep  
The greatness of my hate for you  
Sometimes I can not sleep  
For I miss you  
  
May your day be bright as the eyes  
Of the girl that I once knew  
May your sun be happy yellow, babe  
And your sky be baby blue  
  
I miss your manic scratches  
And your howling at the moon  
Ten steps behind me  
With your dustpan and broom  
  
I hope you wish for me  
All the things I wish for you  
Health, hope and happiness  
The sun and the moon  
  
Say hello to the one  
Who really don't have a clue  
I'll be calling you soon  
I think I love you  
  
I do dear, I do.

David Bowie,Maid Of Bond Street,/d/david+bowie/maid+of+bond+street_20036688.html,"This girl is made of lipstick  
Powder and paint  
Sees the pictures of herself  
Every magazine on every shelf  
  
This girl is maid of Bond Street  
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives  
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs  
  
This girl is a lonely girl  
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus  
Buys the Daily News  
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her  
  
This girl is made of loneliness  
A broken heart  
For the boy that she once knew  
Doesn't want to know her any more  
  
And this girl is a lonely girl  
Every thing she wants is hers  
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with  
All the time, to love, all the time  
  
This boy is made of envy  
Jealousy  
He doesn't have a limousine  
Really wants to be a star himself  
  
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films  
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor  
  
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars  
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars  
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares  
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

I love your party heart your playful party heart  
But though you make me laugh you also make me cry  
'Cause I know you only think of me as just a party friend  
And when the party's done you'll say goodbye  
  
A playtime girl like you plays lots of thrills in life it seems  
But oh, what I'd ever give to be the playboy of your dreams  
I'd tame your party heart, your fickle party heart  
And someday that's just what some party boy will do  
  
But I love you so, I guess that I'll cry just as much as you  
When someone breaks your party heart in two  
When someone breaks your party heart in two  
When someone breaks your party heart in two...

She said ""I'm your poison, now you drink a cup.""  
  
In the heat of the night is when she comes alive  
She's gonna push you push you til she's satisfied  
I watch the ice melt fast on her red hot lips  
She whispers ""If you want to taste my love  
why don't you swallow this.""

Love on the rocks  
Love on the rocks  
She's my shot  
Love on the rocks

Just the way she moves, so soft and slippery  
She lives just around the corner, right down the street  
All night we play the horizontal bop right between her sheets

And say you're sick of it all  
Yet, you remain  
'Cause all you need is me

And ask me ""What will I be,  
When I grow up to be a man""?  
  
Me? Nothing!  
  
There's a soft voice  
Singing in your head  
Who can this be?  
I do believe it's me

Laughing in your dreams  
You know who it is  
But you don't like what it means

Diana Ross,Change Of Heart,/d/diana+ross/change+of+heart_20040355.html,"You're trying to tell me something  
Every time I come near  
I got a feeling the message  
Is the one I don't want to hear  
You can deny all you want to  
But I know you enough to know  
Why not come right out and say it  
You've been trying to let me down slow  
So let's talk before the tears drop  
  
You've had a change of heart  
Well I guess that's up to you  
I couldn't change my heart  
Even if I wanted to  
You've had a change of heart  
  
Your kiss sends a message  
And I detect the signs  
I got enough understanding  
Of a lover to realize  
That you can't make him love you  
Though I give you my best  
You're keeping your heart at a distance  
And it breaks me up to confess  
  
Change of heart  
Well I guess that's up to you  
I couldn't change my heart  
Even if I wanted to  
Change of heart  
Baby, everyone to talk to  
You've had a change of heart  
  
Is this just a notion  
A phase that will pass  
A mixed up emotion  
Or is this change gonna last?  
  
Baby let's talk  
Before the tears drop  
  
You've had a change of heart  
Well I guess that's up to you  
I couldn't change my heart  
Even if I wanted to  
Change of heart  
Everyone to talk to  
You've had a change of heart  
Am I losing you, losing you  
  
Change of heart  
I couldn't change my heart  
Am I losing you, losing you  
I couldn't change my heart

Dan Fogelberg,Ghosts,/d/dan+fogelberg/ghosts_20035784.html,"Sometimes in the night I feel it  
Near as my next breath and yet untouchable  
Silently the past comes stealing  
Like the taste of some forbidden sweet  
Along the walls in shadowed rafters  
Moving like a thought through haunted atmospheres  
Muted cries and echoed laughter  
Banished dreams that never sank in sleep  
Lost in love and found in reason  
Questions that the mind can find no answers for  
Ghostly eyes conspire treason  
As they gather just outside the door  
And every ghost that calls upon us  
Brings another measure in the mystery  
Death is there to keep us honest  
And constantly remind us we are free  
Down the ancient corridors  
And through the gates of time  
Run the ghosts of days that we've left behind  
Down the ancient corridors  
And through the gates of time  
Run the ghosts of dreams that we left behind  
Sometimes in the night I feel it  
Near as my next breath and yet untouchable  
Silently the past comes stealing  
Like the taste of some forbidden sweet  
And every ghost that calls upon us  
Brings another measure in the mystery  
Death is there to keep us honest  
And constantly remind us we are free  
Down the ancient corridors  
And through the gates of time  
Run the ghosts of days that we've left behind  
Down the ancient corridors  
And through the gates of time  
Run the ghosts of dreams that we left behind

O.A.R.,Back To One,/o/oar/back+to+one_20977634.html,"I see you there,  
But you don't look right  
You got a ten mile stare,  
In your eyes tonight  
Time ain't fair,  
Like it used to be  
  
We're all dressed up,  
Nowhere to go  
We lost our way,  
About halfway home  
And we hurt the ones  
Who get too close  
  
Don't look back,  
You'll never find your way  
There's a million different people  
Who break the same way  
When everything has come undone,  
We got to bring it back to one  
Back to one  
We're all caught up  
In what used to be  
A grounded love,  
And some memories  
Why do I hurt the ones  
Who get close to me?  
Darling, are you listening?  
  
Don't look back,  
You'll never find your way  
There's a million different people  
Who break the same way  
Forget about the things we've done,  
And bring it back to one  
More night,  
Another's on the way  
We're all a little different,  
But break the same way  
When everything becomes undone,  
Bring it back to one  
Bring it back to one more night  
Bring it back to one  
Let's bring it back to one  
Bring it back to one  
It's just beyond my reach  
So bring me back to one  
  
I know forever always asks so much,  
Don't you let it scare you  
Don't you lose your touch  
And when your still waters start to run,  
Bring it back to one  
  
One more night,  
Another's on the way  
We're all a little different,  
But break the same way  
When everything becomes un-  
Everything becomes un-  
Don't look back  
We'll never find the way  
A million different people will break  
The same way  
When everything becomes undone,  
Bring it back to one

Patti Smith,Death Singing,/p/patti+smith/death+singing_20105274.html,"In the straw-colored light  
In light rapidly changing  
On a life rapidly fading  
  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
  
With a throat smooth as a lamb  
Yet dry as a branch not snapping  
He throws back his head  
And he does not sing a thing mournful  
  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
In the straw-colored light  
  
He sings a black embrade  
And white opals swimming  
In a child's leather purse  
Have you seen death swimming  
Have you seen death swimming  
  
With a throat smooth as a lamb  
  
Yet dry as a branch not snapping  
He throws back his head  
And he does not sing a thing mournful  
  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
In the straw-colored light  
  
He sings of youth enraged  
And the burning of Atlanta  
And these viral times  
And May ribbons streaming  
And straw-colored curls a-turning  
A mother's vain delight  
And woe to the sun  
And woe to the young  
Another hearse is drawn  
Have you seen death singing  
In the straw-colored light

Nightwish,Dead Boy's Poem,/n/nightwish/dead+boys+poem_10192513.html,"Born from silence, silence full of it  
A perfect concert my best friend  
So much to live for, so much to die for  
If only my heart had a home  
  
Sing what you can't say  
Forget what you can't play  
Hasten to drown into beautiful eyes  
Walk within my poetry, this dying music  
My love letter to nobody  
  
Never sigh for better world  
It's already composed, played and told  
Every thought the music I write  
Everything a wish for the night  
  
Wrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin  
Died for the beauty the one in the garden  
Created a kingdom, reached for the wisdom  
Failed in becoming a god  
  
Never sigh  
  
""If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it  
Remember only the verse, songmaker's cry, the one without tears  
For I've given this its strength and it has become my only strength.  
Comforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortality  
Where being wanted became a thrill I never knew  
The sweet piano writing down my life""  
  
""Teach me passion for I fear it's gone  
Show me love, hold the lorn  
So much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me  
I'm sorry  
Time will tell (this bitter farewell)  
I live no more to shame nor me nor you  
  
And you, I wish I didn't feel for you anymore""

We washed and drank in  
God's tears of joy,  
And for once...and for everyone...  
The truth was not a mystery--  
  
Love called to all...music is magic.  
As we passed over and beyond the walls of nay.  
Hand in hand as we lived and  
Made real the dreams of peaceful men--  
  
We came together...danced with  
The pearls of rainy weather  
Riding the waves of music and  
Space--music is magic...  
Magic is life...  
Love as never loved before...  
Harmony to son and daughter...man and wife.

Horrible Histories,Pilgrim Rap,/h/horrible+histories/pilgrim+rap_21018233.html,"We're the pilgrim fathers  
You may have heard rather  
A lot 'bout our notions  
Crossing the ocean  
On the good ship Mayflower  
But it's true our journey  
Turned into quite a commotion.  
  
People report that we sported these hats  
But that's not true, I mean, would you?  
Anyway the main thing to say  
We began the usa  
Our little band of religion fans  
From the East Midlands.  
  
We all believed slowly  
That England was becoming less holy  
So set off for Holland  
Cause there we had friends  
But in the end seemed the Netherlands  
Would never be the land, we planned.  
  
Couldn't stand to remain on that terrain  
So again we rearranged  
To start a new nation with our congregation  
A new and calmer life took a farmer and a builder and his wife  
And a clerica, to find America.  
  
Oh it's a new world  
It wasn't new to the natives  
Still we thought we'd claim it  
Yeah, it's the new world.  
  
I still remember 9th of November  
The year 1620 and we saw plenty of land  
We thanked God when we found ground  
I kept calm but it didn't go as planned.  
  
Couldn't land on the sand  
A month later though, we made it  
New Plymouth man, we claimed it  
The natives said not  
But ran when we shot.  
  
Moved there it proved yeah  
That life would be tough  
Cause we didn't have enough  
Of the right stuff.  
Did you know had no seeds we could grow  
Although William Mullins had stacked  
126 pairs of shoes in his pack  
Now that's whack.  
  
A fishing rod, a plough,  
A pig, or a cow  
Would have been a much better idea  
But now there's no food for us to eat  
Does this mean that we'll meet with de feet!  
  
No fun in the new world  
I'm glad we've arrived here  
But will we survive here  
Yeah, in the new world.  
  
People were staving  
Our numbers halving  
And when the winter winds blew  
Even fewer live through  
It wasn't pretty in our new city  
But the natives took pity even though  
They didn't have to.  
  
Man called Squanto  
Showed us how to grow maize  
Catch eel for a meal  
Build shelter in the baze  
Tribe gave us a feast  
Our starvation ceased  
What they had done  
Turned us back from the dead  
To the living and to this day  
That's why we have thanks-giving.  
  
In Massachusetts built a colony it's true  
They say modern America was founded by our crew  
It's a new world  
But we can't call it England  
Let's call it New England  
Yeah, in the world.  
  
My home was in Plymouth  
Lets call it New Plymouth  
I got an idea let's call this New Hampshire  
Wait I'm from Newcastle  
Can we call it New Newcastle?  
Nah!  
It's a new world.

Joni Mitchell,Refuge Of The Roads,/j/joni+mitchell/refuge+of+the+roads_20075347.html,"I met a friend of spirit  
He drank and womanized  
And I sat before his sanity  
I was holding back from crying  
He saw my complications  
And he mirrored me back simplified  
And we laughed how our perfection  
Would always be denied  
""Heart and humor and humility""  
He said ""Will lighten up your heavy load""  
I left him for the refuge of the roads  
  
I fell in with some drifters  
Cast upon a beach town  
Winn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs  
And I wound up fixing dinner  
For them and Boston Jim  
I well up with affection  
Thinking back down the roads to then  
The nets were overflowing  
In the Gulf of Mexico  
They were overflowing in the refuge of the roads  
  
There was spring along the ditches  
There were good times in the cities  
Oh, radiant happiness  
It was all so light and easy  
Till I started analyzing  
And I brought on my old ways  
A thunderhead of judgment was  
Gathering in my gaze  
And it made most people nervous  
They just didn't want to know  
What I was seeing in the refuge of the roads  
  
I pulled off into a forest  
Crickets clicking in the ferns  
Like a wheel of fortune  
I heard my fate turn, turn turn  
And I went running down a white sand road  
I was running like a white-assed deer  
Running to lose the blues  
To the innocence in here  
These are the clouds of Michelangelo  
Muscular with gods and sungold  
Shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads  
  
In a highway service station  
Over the month of June  
Was a photograph of the earth  
Taken coming back from the moon  
And you couldn't see a city  
On that marbled bowling ball  
Or a forest or a highway  
Or me here least of all  
You couldn't see these cold water restrooms  
Or this baggage overload  
Westbound and rolling taking refuge in the roads

[Chorus:]  
Cuz it's a girl's night  
It's alright without you  
I'm gonna stay out  
And play out without you  
You better hold tight  
This girl's night is without you  
Let's go  
G. N. O.  
Let's go  
It's a girl's night

Let's go out on the town  
Give it a piece of your mind  
You've been going 'round and 'round in your head  
So don't think twice  
You'll end up worse than you've been  
  
'Cause I know that you've been thinkin' 'bout it  
And I know they think you're out of your mind  
All of this time  
I know that you've been waiting for this  
  
So come on, shout it out so everybody can hear  
There's no need to rhyme it: the message is clear  
You know I can't ignore  
So I don't know what you're waiting for  
But you're trying hard not to show it  
  
'Cause I know that you've been thinkin' 'bout it  
Well, I know they think you're out of your mind  
All of this time  
I know that you've been waiting for this  
Come on, come on  
I know that you've been waiting for this  
  
Can't figure out how we made it this far  
If you don't mind me sayin'  
There's no sense in waiting so  
Shout it out, shout it out  
Shout it out, shout it out  
You can't deny it, you can't deny it  
  
'Cause I know that you've been thinkin' 'bout it  
And I know they think you're out of your mind

Alabama,A Candle In The Window,/a/alabama/a+candle+in+the+window_20005143.html,"There's a road that I remember leading to a special place  
Where the door was always open to a smiling face  
There's a picture on the mantle of a boy that looks like me  
It's always the same, there's a stocking with my name  
  
And a candle in the window, a flame against the night  
There's a candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light  
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window  
  
Maybe it's just wishful thiking I can hear the sleigh bells ring  
Almost taste teh pie she's baking, it's Christmas Eve  
  
And there's a candle in the window, a flame against the night  
The candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light  
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart  
  
Wherever the years may take me no matter how far I go  
There's going to be a candle burning, it's always nice to know  
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart

Pretenders,Birds Of Paradise,/p/pretenders/birds+of+paradise_20110693.html,"I wrote a letter to you my friend  
So many letters that I never send  
I think about you at the day's end  
The time that we had  
I laughed in my bed  
The stupid things you said  
We were two birds of paradise  
  
When I was a little girl  
With clay horses and lambs on the shelf  
I caught frogs in ditches, listened for elves  
My friends and I had a world unto ourselves  
No grownups could find us when we  
Made our plans so secretly  
To run away and fly to be  
With the two birds of paradise  
  
Now once upon a time my mind still there wanders  
Back in the room the things I remember  
One time when we took off our clothes  
But you were cryin', cryin'  
You said nothing lasts forever  
We were happy together  
I thought about you in Stockholm and Rome  
Me in my hotel room  
You in your home  
This is the life they say that  
Dreams are made of  
Don't forget  
Please do forgive me  
I still have something you did give me  
Come into my dream with me and dream  
  
Please don't forget  
Do forgive me  
I still have something you did give me  
Come into my dream with me and dream  
Oh dream of paradise

I ain't gonna crawl  
You ain't gonna nail my heart to the wall  
You ain't gonna find me crying like a child just asking for it all  
I ain't gonna beg, I'd rather lose it all instead  
If that is what it takes to get you Part of me just might let you  
For someone like you, I'd do more than fall  
I just might crawl  
  
Seems like I get this feelin' this time of night  
Head down senses reeling, something just ain't right  
Imagination locked up inside and it's got nowhere to go  
I see my lover through anothers eyes  
And it's killing me to know the truth  
Like playing with fire To lose you  
I'd be a liar if I said

Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw  
Cos you've got me crawlin', crawlin' on the floor  
And I've never met a girl like you before  
  
You've made me acknowledge the devil in me  
I hope to God I'm talkin' metaphorically  
Hope that I'm talkin' allegorically  
Know that I'm talkin' about the way I feel  
And I've never known a girl like you before  
Never, never, never, never  
Never known a girl like you before

Too many protest singers  
Not enough protest songs

Cher,Apples Don't Fall Far From The Tree,/c/cher/apples+dont+fall+far+from+the+tree_20515151.html,"Apples don'T fall far from the tree  
Writer Bob Stone  
  
When I was five  
I put on Mama's high heel shoes  
And paint my face  
And dance across the living room  
In Ruby's place  
Well the music was always playing  
Girls laugh while the men were sayin'  
  
Chorus:  
  
Apples don't fall far from the tree  
Hey, honey come sit on my knee  
Apples don't fall far from the tree  
And I remember Mama's tears  
When they said in a few years  
I'd be something to see  
  
At seventeen I had me a diamond  
And a string of pearls  
The men said they preffered me  
To the other girls  
They took me to the best places  
But I could read it on their faces  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Then when Mama died I made up my mind  
To get on a Greyhound, get out of this town  
And leave it all behind  
  
But life goes on  
A child of three smiles up at me  
While she plays  
The man I love has never heard of ""Ruby's Place""  
When he holds her with affection  
And he uses that old expression  
  
[Chorus:]
